29292031	2017-12-28	10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.12.026	EBioMedicine	Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Enable Discrimination of Heterogeneous Digital Pathology Images.	Pathological evaluation of tumor tissue is pivotal for diagnosis in cancer patients and automated image analysis approaches have great potential to increase precision of diagnosis and help reduce human error. In this study, we utilize several computational methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and build a stand-alone pipeline to effectively classify different histopathology images across different types of cancer. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of our pipeline to discriminate between two subtypes of lung cancer, four biomarkers of bladder cancer, and five biomarkers of breast cancer. In addition, we apply our pipeline to discriminate among four immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining scores of bladder and breast cancers. Our classification pipeline includes a basic CNN architecture, Google's Inceptions with three training strategies, and an ensemble of two state-of-the-art algorithms, Inception and ResNet. Training strategies include training the last layer of Google's Inceptions, training the network from scratch, and fine-tunning the parameters for our data using two pre-trained version of Google's Inception architectures, Inception-V1 and Inception-V3. We demonstrate the power of deep learning approaches for identifying cancer subtypes, and the robustness of Google's Inceptions even in presence of extensive tumor heterogeneity. On average, our pipeline achieved accuracies of 100%, 92%, 95%, and 69% for discrimination of various cancer tissues, subtypes, biomarkers, and scores, respectively.

34330122	2021-08-23	10.1088/1361-6560/ac195e	Physics in medicine and biology	CrossModalNet: exploiting quality preoperative images for multimodal image registration.	A long-standing problem in image-guided radiotherapy is that inferior intraoperative images present a difficult problem for automatic registration algorithms. Particularly for digital radiography (DR) and digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR), the blurred, low-contrast, and noisy DR makes the multimodal registration of DR-DRR challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel CNN-based method called CrossModalNet to exploit the quality preoperative modality (DRR) for handling the limitations of intraoperative images (DR), thereby improving the registration accuracy. The method consists of two parts: DR-DRR contour predictions and contour-based rigid registration. We have designed the CrossModal Attention Module and CrossModal Refine Module to fully exploit the multiscale crossmodal features and implement the crossmodal interactions during the feature encoding and decoding stages. Then, the predicted anatomical contours of DR-DRR are registered by the classic mutual information method. We collected 2486 patient scans to train CrossModalNet and 170 scans to test its performance. The results show that it outperforms the classic and state-of-the-art methods with 95th percentile Hausdorff distance of 5.82 pixels and registration accuracy of 81.2%.

Hyperparameters are numerical pre-sets whose values are assigned prior to the commencement of a learning process. Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is often critical for achieving satisfactory performance in many vision problems, such as deep learning-based visual object tracking. However, it is often difficult to determine their optimal values, especially if they are specific to each video input. Most hyperparameter optimization algorithms tend to search a generic range and are imposed blindly on all sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical hyperparameter optimization method that adaptively optimizes hyperparameters for a given sequence using an action-prediction network leveraged on continuous deep Q-learning. Since the observation space for object tracking is significantly more complex than those in traditional control problems, existing continuous deep Q-learning algorithms cannot be directly applied. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient heuristic strategy to handle high dimensional state space, while also accelerating the convergence behavior. The proposed algorithm is applied to improve two representative trackers, a Siamese-based one and a correlation-filter-based one, to evaluate its generalizability. Their superior performances on several popular benchmarks are clearly demonstrated.

31870979	2019-12-23	10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2961672	IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence	Learned Dynamic Guidance for Depth Image Reconstruction.	The depth images acquired by consumer depth sensors (e.g., Kinect and ToF) usually are of low resolution and insufficient quality. One natural solution is to incorporate a high resolution RGB camera and exploit the statistical correlation of its data and depth. In recent years, both optimization-based and learning-based approaches have been proposed to deal with the guided depth reconstruction problems. In this paper, we introduce a weighted analysis sparse representation (WASR) model for guided depth image enhancement, which can be considered a generalized formulation of a wide range of previous optimization-based models. We unfold the optimization by the WASR model and conduct guided depth reconstruction with dynamically changed stage-wise operations. Such a guidance strategy enables us to dynamically adjust the stage-wise operations that update the depth image, thus improving the reconstruction quality and speed. To learn the stage-wise operations in a task-driven manner, we propose two parameterizations and their corresponding methods: dynamic guidance with Gaussian RBF nonlinearity parameterization (DG-RBF) and dynamic guidance with CNN nonlinearity parameterization (DG-CNN). The network structures of the proposed DG-RBF and DG-CNN methods are designed with the the objective function of our WASR model in mind and the optimal network parameters are learned from paired training data. Such optimization-inspired network architectures enable our models to leverage the previous expertise as well as take benefit from training data. The effectiveness is validated for guided depth image super-resolution and for realistic depth image reconstruction tasks using standard benchmarks. Our DG-RBF and DG-CNN methods achieve the best quantitative results (RMSE) and better visual quality than the state-of-the-art approaches at the time of writing.

Multitask joint learning technology continues gaining more attention as a paradigm shift and has shown promising performance in many applications. Depth estimation and semantic understanding from monocular images emerge as a challenging problem in computer vision. While the other joint learning frameworks establish the relationship between the semantics and depth from stereo pairs, the lack of learning camera motion renders the frameworks that fail to model the geometric structure of the image scene. We make a further step in this article by proposing a multitask learning method, namely DPSNet, which can jointly perform depth and camera pose estimation and semantic scene segmentation. Our core idea for depth and camera pose prediction is that we present the rigid semantic consistency loss to overcome the limitation of moving pixels from image reconstruction technology and further infer the segmentation of moving instances based on them. In addition, our proposed model performs semantic segmentation by reasoning the geometric correspondences between the pixel semantic outputs and the semantic labels at multiscale resolutions. Experiments on open-source datasets and a video dataset captured on a micro-smart car show the effectiveness of each component of DPSNet, and DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art results in all three tasks compared with the best popular methods.

35224614	2022-03-10	10.1093/bib/bbac016	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying drug-target interactions via heterogeneous graph attention networks combined with cross-modal similarities.	Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a crucial role in drug discovery. Compared with traditional experimental methods that are labor-intensive and time-consuming, computational methods are more and more popular in recent years. Conventional computational methods almost simply view heterogeneous networks which integrate diverse drug-related and target-related dataset instead of fully exploring drug and target similarities. In this paper, we propose a new method, named DTIHNC, for $\mathbf{D}$rug-$\mathbf{T}$arget $\mathbf{I}$nteraction identification, which integrates $\mathbf{H}$eterogeneous $\mathbf{N}$etworks and $\mathbf{C}$ross-modal similarities calculated by relations between drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects. Firstly, the low-dimensional features of drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects are obtained from original features by a denoising autoencoder. Then, we construct a heterogeneous network across drug, protein, disease and side-effect nodes. In heterogeneous network, we exploit the heterogeneous graph attention operations to update the embedding of a node based on information in its 1-hop neighbors, and for multi-hop neighbor information, we propose random walk with restart aware graph attention to integrate more information through a larger neighborhood region. Next, we calculate cross-modal drug and protein similarities from cross-scale relations between drugs, proteins, diseases and side effects. Finally, a multiple-layer convolutional neural network deeply integrates similarity information of drugs and proteins with the embedding features obtained from heterogeneous graph attention network. Experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness and better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

The on-going data-science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution offer researchers a fresh set of tools to approach structure-based drug design problems in the computer-aided drug design space. A novel programmatic tool that incorporates  and deep learning based approaches for  drug design for any target of interest has been reported. Once the user specifies the target of interest in the form of a representative amino acid sequence or corresponding nucleotide sequence, the programmatic workflow of the tool generates compounds from the PubChem ligand library and novel SMILES of compounds not present in any ligand library but are likely to be active against the target. Following this, the tool performs a computationally efficient  modeling of the target and the newly generated compounds and stores the results of the protein-ligand interaction in the working folder of the user. Further, for the protein-ligand complex associated with the best protein-ligand interaction, the tool performs an automated Molecular Dynamics (MD) protocol and generates plots such as RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) which reveal the stability of the complex. A demonstrated use of the tool has been shown with the target signatures of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha, an important therapeutic target in the case of anti-inflammatory treatment. The future scope of the tool involves, running the tool on a High-Performance Cluster for all known target signatures to generate data that will be useful to drive AI and Big data driven drug discovery.

28714590	2017-07-17	10.1002/gepi.22059	Genetic epidemiology	Adaptive testing for association between two random vectors in moderate to high dimensions.	Testing for association between two random vectors is a common and important task in many fields, however, existing tests, such as Escoufier's RV test, are suitable only for low-dimensional data, not for high-dimensional data. In moderate to high dimensions, it is necessary to consider sparse signals, which are often expected with only a few, but not many, variables associated with each other. We generalize the RV test to moderate-to-high dimensions. The key idea is to data adaptively weight each variable pair based on its empirical association. As the consequence, the proposed test is adaptive, alleviating the effects of noise accumulation in high-dimensional data, and thus maintaining the power for both dense and sparse alternative hypotheses. We show the connections between the proposed test with several existing tests, such as a generalized estimating equations-based adaptive test, multivariate kernel machine regression (KMR), and kernel distance methods. Furthermore, we modify the proposed adaptive test so that it can be powerful for nonlinear or nonmonotonic associations. We use both real data and simulated data to demonstrate the advantages and usefulness of the proposed new test.

Cross-linking/mass spectrometry is an increasingly popular approach to obtain structural information on proteins and their complexes in solution. However, methods for error assessment are under current development. We note that false-discovery rates can be estimated at different points during data analysis, and are most relevant for residue or protein pairs. Missing this point led in our example analysis to an actual 8.4% error when 5% error was targeted. In addition, prefiltering of peptide-spectrum matches and of identified peptide pairs substantially improved results. In our example, this prefiltering increased the number of residue pairs (5% FDR) by 33% (n = 108 to n = 144). This number improvement did not come at the expense of reduced accuracy as the added data agreed with an available crystal structure.

Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early signs of breast cancer can be an abnormality depicted on breast images (e.g., mammography or breast ultrasonography). However, reliable interpretation of breast images requires intensive labor and physicians with extensive experience. Deep learning is evolving breast imaging diagnosis by introducing a second opinion to physicians. However, most deep learning-based breast cancer analysis algorithms lack interpretability because of their black box nature, which means that domain experts cannot understand why the algorithms predict a label. In addition, most deep learning algorithms are formulated as a single-task-based model that ignores correlations between different tasks (e.g., tumor classification and segmentation). In this paper, we propose an interpretable multitask information bottleneck network (MIB-Net) to accomplish simultaneous breast tumor classification and segmentation. MIB-Net maximizes the mutual information between the latent representations and class labels while minimizing information shared by the latent representations and inputs. In contrast from existing models, our MIB-Net generates a contribution score map that offers an interpretable aid for physicians to understand the model's decision-making process. In addition, MIB-Net implements multitask learning and further proposes a dual prior knowledge guidance strategy to enhance deep task correlation. Our evaluations are carried out on three breast image datasets in different modalities. Our results show that the proposed framework is not only able to help physicians better understand the model's decisions but also improve breast tumor classification and segmentation accuracy over representative state-of-the-art models.

Visual tracking addresses the problem of localizing an arbitrary target in video according to the annotated bounding box. In this article, we present a novel tracking method by introducing the attention mechanism into the Siamese network to increase its matching discrimination. We propose a new way to compute attention weights to improve matching performance by a sub-Siamese network [Attention Net (A-Net)], which locates attentive parts for solving the searching problem. In addition, features in higher layers can preserve more semantic information while features in lower layers preserve more location information. Thus, in order to solve the tracking failure cases by the higher layer features, we fully utilize location and semantic information by multilevel features and propose a new way to fuse multiscale response maps from each layer to obtain a more accurate position estimation of the object. We further propose a hierarchical attention Siamese network by combining the attention weights and multilayer integration for tracking. Our method is implemented with a pretrained network which can outperform most well-trained Siamese trackers even without any fine-tuning and online updating.

The development of third-generation sequencing technology has brought significant changes and influences on genomics. Compared to the second-generation sequencing methods, the third-generation technologies produce around 100 times longer reads to reveal new genomic variations that complete long-term gaps in the human reference genome. However, these reads' excessive length and high error rate severely increase the amount of data and alignment cost. The traditional data analysis platform and serial sequence alignment method can not effectively deal with large-scale long read alignment. There is a critical need for a novel data analysis platform that can deliver fast alignment of large-scale sequences to solve the problem of long read alignment. High-performance computing platforms and efficient, scalable algorithms based on these platforms have significant potential to impact sequence analysis approaches. This paper presented minimapR, a multi-level parallel long-read alignment tool based on minimap2, a popular third-generation read aligner. MinimapR is developed based on the new high-performance distributed framework Ray. Ray fully integrates with the Python environment and can be easily installed with pip. MinimapR can utilize the power of multiple computing nodes, significantly accelerating alignment speeds without sacrificing sensitivity.

Single-cell RNA transcriptome data present a tremendous opportunity for studying the cellular heterogeneity. Identifying subpopulations based on scRNA-seq data is a hot topic in recent years, although many researchers have been focused on designing elegant computational methods for identifying new cell types; however, the performance of these methods is still unsatisfactory due to the high dimensionality, sparsity and noise of scRNA-seq data. In this study, we propose a new cell type detection method by learning a robust and accurate similarity matrix, named SCCLRR. The method simultaneously captures both global and local intrinsic properties of data based on a low rank representation (LRR) framework mathematical model. The integrated normalized Euclidean distance and cosine similarity are used to balance the intrinsic linear and nonlinear manifold of data in the local regularization term. To solve the non-convex optimization model, we present an iterative optimization procedure using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the SCCLRR method on nine real scRNA-seq datasets and compare it with seven state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results show that the SCCLRR outperforms other methods and is robust and effective for clustering scRNA-seq data.

Training a deep convolutional network from scratch requires a large amount of labeled data, which however may not be available for many practical tasks. To alleviate the data burden, a practical approach is to adapt a pre-trained model learned on the large source domain to the target domain, but the performance can be limited when the source and target domain data distributions have large differences. Some recent works attempt to alleviate this issue by imposing feature alignment over the intermediate feature maps between the source and target networks. However, for a source model, many of the channels/spatial-features for each layer can be irrelevant to the target task. Thus, directly applying feature alignment may not achieve promising performance. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Feature Alignment (AFA) method for effective domain knowledge transfer by identifying and attending on the relevant channels and spatial features between two domains. To this end, we devise two learnable attentive modules at both the channel and spatial levels. We then sequentially perform attentive spatial- and channel-level feature alignments between the source and target networks, in which the target model and attentive module are learned simultaneously. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the generalization performance of our method, which confirms its superiority to existing methods.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly considered to be state-of-the-art generic end-to-end image classification systems. However, they are known to underperform when training data are limited and thus require data augmentation strategies that render the method computationally expensive and not always effective. Rather than using a data augmentation strategy to encode invariances as typically done in machine learning, here we propose to mathematically augment a nearest subspace classification model in sliced-Wasserstein space by exploiting certain mathematical properties of the Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (R-CDT), a recently introduced image transform. We demonstrate that for a particular type of learning problem, our mathematical solution has advantages over data augmentation with deep CNNs in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity, and is particularly effective under a limited training data setting. The method is simple, effective, computationally efficient, non-iterative, and requires no parameters to be tuned. Python code implementing our method is available at https://github.com/rohdelab/mathematical augmentation. Our method is integrated as a part of the software package PyTransKit, which is available at https://github.com/rohdelab/PyTransKit.	github.com/rohdelab/mathematical	https://github.com/rohdelab/mathematical/	rohdelab	mathematical			0.0	0.0		2023-01-31	2022-12-22	wrong link	https://github.com/rohdelab/mathematical_augmentation/

34718405	2022-01-17	10.1093/bib/bbab442	Briefings in bioinformatics	Are dropout imputation methods for scRNA-seq effective for scATAC-seq data?	The tremendous progress of single-cell sequencing technology has given researchers the opportunity to study cell development and differentiation processes at single-cell resolution. Assay of Transposase-Accessible Chromatin by deep sequencing (ATAC-seq) was proposed for genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility. Due to technical limitations or other reasons, dropout events are almost a common occurrence for extremely sparse single-cell ATAC-seq data, leading to confusion in downstream analysis (such as clustering). Although considerable progress has been made in the estimation of scRNA-seq data, there is currently no specific method for the inference of dropout events in single-cell ATAC-seq data. In this paper, we select several state-of-the-art scRNA-seq imputation methods (including MAGIC, SAVER, scImpute, deepImpute, PRIME, bayNorm and knn-smoothing) in recent years to infer dropout peaks in scATAC-seq data, and perform a systematic evaluation of these methods through several downstream analyses. Specifically, we benchmarked these methods in terms of correlation with meta-cell, clustering, subpopulations distance analysis, imputation performance for corruption datasets, identification of TF motifs and computation time. The experimental results indicated that most of the imputed peaks increased the correlation with the reference meta-cell, while the performance of different methods on different datasets varied greatly in different downstream analyses, thus should be used with caution. In general, MAGIC performed better than the other methods most consistently across all assessments.

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the first-line investigation in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with dyspnoea and are a valuable adjunct to clinical management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to facilitate rapid triage of CXRs for further patient testing and/or isolation. In this work we develop an AI algorithm, CovIx, to differentiate normal, abnormal, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 CXRs using a multicentre cohort of 293,143 CXRs. The algorithm is prospectively validated in 3289 CXRs acquired from patients presenting to ED with symptoms of COVID-19 across four sites in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. CovIx achieves area under receiver operating characteristic curve for COVID-19 of 0.86, with sensitivity and F1-score up to 0.83 and 0.71 respectively, and performs on-par with four board-certified radiologists.

"Strategies for drug discovery and repositioning are an urgent need with respect to COVID-19. We developed ""REDIAL-2020"", a suite of machine learning models for estimating small molecule activity from molecular structure, for a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays. Each classifier is based on three distinct types of descriptors (fingerprint, physicochemical, and pharmacophore) for parallel model development. These models were trained using high throughput screening data from the NCATS COVID19 portal (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html), with multiple categorical machine learning algorithms. The ""best models"" are combined in an ensemble consensus predictor that outperforms single models where external validation is available. This suite of machine learning models is available through the DrugCentral web portal (<a href=""https://drugdiscovery.utep.edu/redial"">http://drugcentral.org/Redial</a>). Acceptable input formats are: drug name, PubChem CID, or SMILES; the output is an estimate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. The web application reports estimated activity across three areas (,  and ) spanning six independent models, followed by a similarity search that displays the most similar molecules to the query among experimentally determined data. The ML models have 60% to 74% external predictivity, based on three separate datasets. Complementing the NCATS COVID19 portal, REDIAL-2020 can serve as a rapid online tool for identifying active molecules for COVID-19 treatment. The source code and specific models are available through Github (<a href=""https://github.com/sirimullalab/ncats_covid"">https://github.com/sirimullalab/</a>redial-2020), or via Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/sirimullalab/redial-2020) for users preferring a containerized version.

WBIR (Workshop : 2006- ) (10th : 2022 : Munich, Germany)	SuperWarp: Supervised Learning and Warping on U-Net for Invariant Subvoxel-Precise Registration.	In recent years, learning-based image registration methods have gradually moved away from direct supervision with target warps to instead use self-supervision, with excellent results in several registration benchmarks. These approaches utilize a loss function that penalizes the intensity differences between the fixed and moving images, along with a suitable regularizer on the deformation. However, since images typically have large untextured regions, merely maximizing similarity between the two images is not sufficient to recover the true deformation. This problem is exacerbated by texture in other regions, which introduces severe non-convexity into the landscape of the training objective and ultimately leads to overfitting. In this paper, we argue that the relative failure of supervised registration approaches can in part be blamed on the use of regular U-Nets, which are jointly tasked with feature extraction, feature matching and deformation estimation. Here, we introduce a simple but crucial modification to the U-Net that disentangles feature extraction and matching from deformation prediction, allowing the U-Net to warp the features, across levels, as the deformation field is evolved. With this modification, direct supervision using target warps begins to outperform self-supervision approaches that require segmentations, presenting new directions for registration when images do not have segmentations. We hope that our findings in this preliminary workshop paper will re-ignite research interest in supervised image registration techniques.

We tackle the cross-domain visual localization problem of estimating camera position and orientation from real images without three-dimensional (3D) spatial mapping or modeling. Recent studies have shown suboptimal performance in this task owing to the photometric and geometric differences between synthetic and real images. In this study, we present a deep learning approach that uses a channel-wise transformer localization (CT-Loc) framework. Inspired by the human behavior of looking for structural landmarks to estimate one's location, CT-Loc encodes the most salient features of task-relevant objects in target scenes. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method in a real-world application, we built a complex and large-scale dataset of the interior of the mechanical room during operations and conducted extensive performance comparisons with the publicly available state-of-the-art University of Melbourne Corridor and Virtual KITTI 2 datasets. Compared with the otherwise best-performing BIM-PoseNet indoor camera localization model, our method significantly reduces position and orientation errors through the application of attention weights and saliency maps while also learning only the visual structural patterns (e.g., floors and doors) that are most relevant to localization tasks. Our model successfully ignores uninformative objects. This approach yields higher-level robust camera-pose regression localization results without requiring prebuilt maps.

Parts2Whole: Self-supervised Contrastive Learning via Reconstruction.	Contrastive representation learning is the state of the art in computer vision, but requires huge mini-batch sizes, special network design, or memory banks, making it unappealing for 3D medical imaging, while in 3D medical imaging, reconstruction-based self-supervised learning reaches a new height in performance, but lacks mechanisms to learn contrastive representation; therefore, this paper proposes a new framework for self-supervised contrastive learning via reconstruction, called Parts2Whole, because it exploits the  and  part-whole relationship to learn contrastive representation without using contrastive loss: Reconstructing an image (whole) from its own parts compels the model to learn similar latent features for all its own parts, while reconstructing different images (wholes) from their respective parts forces the model to simultaneously push those parts belonging to different wholes farther apart from each other in the latent space; thereby the trained model is capable of distinguishing images. We have evaluated our Parts2Whole on five distinct imaging tasks covering both classification and segmentation, and compared it with four competing publicly available 3D pretrained models, showing that Parts2Whole significantly outperforms in two out of five tasks while achieves competitive performance on the rest three. This superior performance is attributable to the contrastive representations learned with Parts2Whole.

This reports describes a prototype web service application that uses picker APIs to expose a new, ""cloudified"", API tailored for image analysis, without compromising the private governance of the data exposed. In order to better understand this cross-platform cloud computing landscape, we first measured the time for both transfer and traversing of large image files generated by whole slide imaging (WSI) in Digital Pathology. The verification that there is extensive interconnectivity between cloud resources let to the development of a prototype software application that exposes an image-traversing REST API to image files stored in any of the consumer-facing ""boxes"". In summary, an image file can be upload/synchronized into a any cloud resource with a file picker API and the prototype service described here will expose an HTTP REST API that remains within the safety of the user's own governance.

35947011	2022-08-10	10.1094/PDIS-06-22-1325-PDN	Plant disease	First report of Impatiens necrotic spot orthotospovirus infecting Tulbaghia violacia Harv. in China.	Tulbaghia violacea Harv. indigenous to southern African countries, is an herbaceous perennial bulbous plant belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. It is a popular garden plant in China. This attractive plant is traditionally used as medicine and repellent (Kubec et al. 2002; Moodley et al. 2015). In June 2021, T. violacea plants showing typical tospovirus-like symptoms of chlorotic rings patterns, were found at the campus of Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine (Fig.S1). Disease incidence was about 11.0% during the field survey. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic leaves of T. violacea plants using the TRIzol reagent (ambio, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was conducted to identify the virus using RNA extract as the template. The degenerate primers (dTospo-F2 and dTospo-R2) (Huang et al. 2018) were used to amplify the conserved regions of the orthotospoviral L RNA sequences. No amplification was obtained from extracts of two asymptomatic plants. The amplicons from four symptomatic samples were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa) and sequenced (three clones for each amplicon) by Tsingke (Shanghai, China). The obtained DNA fragments were determined to be 312 bp. The sequences from four symptomatic samples were identical (GenBank acc.no. OK258285) and shared the highest nucleotide identities (98.0%) with a corresponding sequence of segment L of impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) isolated (GQ336991) from Phalaenopsis amabilis in Yunnan province, China. To further confirm the INSV infection to T. violacea, the samples were analyzed with the specific primers for the N, NSs and NSm genes of INSV (Table S1), respectively. Amplicons of the expected size, 789 bp, 1344 bp and 912 bp, were produced, respectively. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The 789-bp N (ON529554) and 1344-bp NSs (ON529554) gene sequences had 99.1% and 99.3% nucleotide identities with the corresponding region of previously described INSV Phalenopsis isolate (GQ336989), respectively. The 912-bp NSm (ON529553) gene sequence shared 99.5% nucleotide identity with the corresponding region of INSV Phalenopsis isolate (GQ336990). Metavirome and Sanger sequencing were used to complete the genome of INSV from T. violacea. The leaves of the symptomatic sample were used to construct an rRNA-depleted library using Nextera XT reagents (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The library was subjected to RNA-Seq a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A total of 33,193,233 quality-filtered reads were obtained using BBMAP (https://github.com/BioInfoTools/BBMapBBMap - Bushnell B. - sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). Among 161052 reads mapped to virus sequences, 151407 reads (read ratios 94.0%) were mapped to INSV. Three complete segments of INSV genome were determined to 8,778 nt (L segment, Acc. No. ON529552), 4,958 nt (M segment, Acc. No. ON529553), and 2,983 nt (S segment, Acc. No. ON529554) in length. These segments were validated by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Three segments share nucleotide sequence identities of 99.6%, 99.3% and 98.9% with the L (GQ336991), M (GQ336990) and S segments (GQ336989) of INSV Phalenopsis isolate, respectively. The results of sequence comparisons showed no evidence of reassortment between INSV and another orthotospovirus. There was a report of tomato spotted wilt virus infecting T. violacea in Florida, USA (Dey et al. 2019). No other virus infecting T. violacea was reported. INSV has been reported to infect several economically important crops including Phalenopsis, pepper etc. in China (Chen et al. 2016).

35767510	2022-10-27	10.1109/TMI.2022.3186677	IEEE transactions on medical imaging	Contrastive and Selective Hidden Embeddings for Medical Image Segmentation.	Medical image segmentation is fundamental and essential for the analysis of medical images. Although prevalent success has been achieved by convolutional neural networks (CNN), challenges are encountered in the domain of medical image analysis by two aspects: 1) lack of discriminative features to handle similar textures of distinct structures and 2) lack of selective features for potential blurred boundaries in medical images. In this paper, we extend the concept of contrastive learning (CL) to the segmentation task to learn more discriminative representation. Specifically, we propose a novel patch-dragsaw contrastive regularization (PDCR) to perform patch-level tugging and repulsing. In addition, a new structure, namely uncertainty-aware feature re- weighting block (UAFR), is designed to address the potential high uncertainty regions in the feature maps and serves as a better feature re- weighting. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results across 8 public datasets from 6 domains. Besides, the method also demonstrates robustness in the limited-data scenario.

Single image super-resolution (SISR) using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Most existing SISR models mainly focus on pursuing high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and neglect textures and details. As a result, the recovered images are often perceptually unpleasant. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a texture and detail-preserving network (TDPN), which focuses not only on local region feature recovery but also on preserving textures and details. Specifically, the high-resolution image is recovered from its corresponding low-resolution input in two branches. First, a multi-reception field based branch is designed to let the network fully learn local region features by adaptively selecting local region features in different reception fields. Then, a texture and detail-learning branch supervised by the textures and details decomposed from the ground-truth high resolution image is proposed to provide additional textures and details for the super-resolution process to improve the perceptual quality. Finally, we introduce a gradient loss into the SISR field and define a novel hybrid loss to strengthen boundary information recovery and to avoid overly smooth boundary in the final recovered high-resolution image caused by using only the MAE loss. More importantly, the proposed method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to most off-the-shelf SISR networks. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our TDPN on most state-of-the-art SISR methods in PSNR, SSIM and perceptual quality.

The current unsupervised domain adaptation person re-identification (re-ID) method aims to solve the domain shift problem and applies prior knowledge learned from labelled data in the source domain to unlabelled data in the target domain for person re-ID. At present, the unsupervised domain adaptation person re-ID method based on pseudolabels has obtained state-of-the-art performance. This method obtains pseudolabels via a clustering algorithm and uses these pseudolabels to optimize a CNN model. Although it achieves optimal performance, the model cannot be further optimized due to the existence of noisy labels in the clustering process. In this paper, we propose a stable median centre clustering (SMCC) for the unsupervised domain adaptation person re-ID method. SMCC adaptively mines credible samples for optimization purposes and reduces the impact of label noise and outliers on training to improve the performance of the resulting model. In particular, we use the intracluster distance confidence measure of the sample and its -reciprocal nearest neighbour cluster proportion in the clustering process to select credible samples and assign different weights according to the intracluster sample distance confidence of samples to measure the distances between different clusters, thereby making the clustering results more robust. The experiments show that our SMCC method can select credible and stable samples for training and improve performance of the unsupervised domain adaptation model.

The process of learning good representations for machine learning tasks can be very computationally expensive. Typically, we facilitate the same backbones learned on the training set to infer the labels of testing data. Interestingly, This learning and inference paradigm, however, is quite different from the typical inference scheme of human biological visual systems. Essentially, neuroscience studies have shown that the right hemisphere of the human brain predominantly makes a fast processing of low-frequency spatial signals, while the left hemisphere more focuses on analyzing high-frequency information in a slower way. And the low-pass analysis helps facilitate the high-pass analysis via a feedback form. Inspired by this biological vision mechanism, this paper explores the possibility of learning a layer-skippable inference network. Specifically, we propose a layer-skippable network that dynamically carries out coarse-tofine object categorization. Such a network has two branches to jointly deal with both coarse and fine-grained classification tasks. The layer-skipping mechanism is proposed to learn a gating network by generating dynamic inference graphs, and reducing the computational cost by detouring the inference path from some layers. This adaptive path inference strategy endows the network with better flexibility and larger capacity and makes the high-performance deep networks with dynamic structures. To efficiently train the gating network, a novel ranking-based loss function is presented. Furthermore, the learned representations are enhanced by the proposed top-down feedback facilitation and feature-wise affine transformation, individually. The former one employs features of a coarse branch to help the finegrained object recognition task, while the latter one encodes the selected path to enhance the final feature representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on several widely used coarse-to-fine object categorization benchmarks, and promising results are achieved by our proposed model. Quite surprisingly, our layer-skipping mechanism improves the network robustness to adversarial attacks.

Lightweight segmentation models are becoming more popular for fast diagnosis on small and low cost medical imaging devices. This study focuses on the segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in cardiac ultrasound (US) images. A new lightweight model [LV network (LVNet)] is proposed for segmentation, which gives the benefits of requiring fewer parameters but with improved segmentation performance in terms of Dice score (DS). The proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art methods, such as UNet, MiniNetV2, and fully convolutional dense dilated network (FCdDN). The model proposed comes with a post-processing pipeline that further enhances the segmentation results. In general, the training is done directly using the segmentation mask as the output and the US image as the input of the model. A new strategy for segmentation is also introduced in addition to the direct training method used. Compared with the UNet model, an improvement in DS performance as high as 5% for segmentation with papillary (WP) muscles was found, while showcasing an improvement of 18.5% when the papillary muscles are excluded. The model proposed requires only 5% of the memory required by a UNet model.

Chunking consists in grouping items of a sequence into small clusters, named chunks, with the assumed goal of lessening working memory load. Despite extensive research, the current methods used to detect chunks, and to identify different chunking strategies, remain discordant and difficult to implement. Here, we propose a simple and reliable method to identify chunks in a sequence and to determine their stability across blocks. This algorithm is based on a ranking method and its major novelty is that it provides concomitantly both the features of individual chunk in a given sequence, and an overall index that quantifies the chunking pattern consistency across sequences. The analysis of simulated data confirmed the validity of our method in different conditions of noise, chunk lengths and chunk numbers; moreover, we found that this algorithm was particularly efficient in the noise range observed in real data, provided that at least 4 sequence repetitions were included in each experimental block. Furthermore, we applied this algorithm to actual reaction time series gathered from 3 published experiments and were able to confirm the findings obtained in the original reports. In conclusion, this novel algorithm is easy to implement, is robust to outliers and provides concurrent and reliable estimation of chunk position and chunking dynamics, making it useful to study both sequence-specific and general chunking effects.

Enhancers regulate gene expression, by playing a crucial role in the synthesis of RNAs and proteins. They do not directly encode proteins or RNA molecules. In order to control gene expression, it is important to predict enhancers and their potency. Given their distance from the target gene, lack of common motifs, and tissue/cell specificity, enhancer regions are thought to be difficult to predict in DNA sequences. Recently, a number of bioinformatics tools were created to distinguish enhancers from other regulatory components and to pinpoint their advantages. However, because the quality of its prediction method needs to be improved, its practical application value must also be improved. Based on nucleotide composition and statistical moment-based features, the current study suggests a novel method for identifying enhancers and non-enhancers and evaluating their strength. The proposed study outperformed state-of-the-art techniques using fivefold and tenfold cross-validation in terms of accuracy. The accuracy from the current study results in 86.5% and 72.3% in enhancer site and its strength prediction respectively.

29994455	2018-02-21	10.1109/TCBB.2018.2808350	IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics	IsoTree: A New Framework for de novo Transcriptome Assembly from RNA-seq Reads.	High-throughput sequencing of mRNA has made the deep and efficient probing of transcriptome more affordable. However, the vast amounts of short RNA-seq reads make de novo transcriptome assembly an algorithmic challenge. In this work, we present IsoTree, a novel framework for transcripts reconstruction in the absence of reference genomes. Unlike most of de novo assembly methods that build de Bruijn graph or splicing graph by connecting k- mers which are sets of overlapping substrings generated from reads, IsoTree constructs splicing graph by connecting reads directly. For each splicing graph, IsoTree applies an iterative scheme of mixed integer linear program to build a prefix tree, called isoform tree. Each path from the root node of the isoform tree to a leaf node represents a plausible transcript candidate which will be pruned based on the information of paired-end reads. Experiments showed that in most cases IsoTree performs better than other leading transcriptome assembly programs.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is of great significance for a wide range of applications, such as delivery and agriculture. Previous benchmarks in this area mainly focused on small-scale tracking problems while ignoring the amounts of data, types of data modalities, diversities of target categories and scenarios, and evaluation protocols involved, greatly hiding the massive power of deep UAV tracking. In this work, we propose WebUAV-3 M, the largest public UAV tracking benchmark to date, to facilitate both the development and evaluation of deep UAV trackers. WebUAV-3 M contains over 3.3 million frames across 4,500 videos and offers 223 highly diverse target categories. Each video is densely annotated with bounding boxes by an efficient and scalable semi-automatic target annotation (SATA) pipeline. Importantly, to take advantage of the complementary superiority of language and audio, we enrich WebUAV-3 M by innovatively providing both natural language specifications and audio descriptions. We believe that such additions will greatly boost future research in terms of exploring language features and audio cues for multi-modal UAV tracking. In addition, a fine-grained UAV tracking-under-scenario constraint (UTUSC) evaluation protocol and seven challenging scenario subtest sets are constructed to enable the community to develop, adapt and evaluate various types of advanced trackers. We provide extensive evaluations and detailed analyses of 43 representative trackers and envision future research directions in the field of deep UAV tracking and beyond.

"The vast amount of sequence data generated to analyze complex traits is posing new challenges in terms of the analysis and interpretation of the results. Although simulation is a fundamental tool to investigate the reliability of genomic analyses and to optimize experimental design, existing software cannot realistically simulate complete genomes. To remedy this, we have developed a new strategy (Sequence-Based Virtual Breeding, SBVB) that uses real sequence data and simulates new offspring genomes and phenotypes in a very efficient and flexible manner. Using this tool, we studied the efficiency of full sequence in genomic prediction compared to SNP arrays. We used real porcine sequences from three breeds as founder genomes of a 2500-animal pedigree and two genetic architectures: ""neutral"" and ""selective."" In the neutral architecture, frequencies and allele effects were sampled independently whereas, in the selective case, SNPs were sites putatively under selection after domestication and a negative correlation between effect and frequency was induced. We compared the effectiveness of different genotyping strategies for genomic selection, including the use of full sequence commercial arrays or randomly chosen SNP sets in both outbred and crossbred experimental designs. We found that accuracy increases using sequence instead of commercial chips but modestly, perhaps by ≤ 4%. This result was robust to extreme genetic architectures. We conclude that full sequence is unlikely to offset commercial arrays for predicting genetic value when the number of loci is relatively large and the prior given to each SNP is uniform. Using sequence to improve selection thus requires optimized prior information and, likely, increased population sizes.

Metagenomics, the sequence characterization of all genomes within a sample, is widely used as a virus discovery tool as well as a tool to study viral diversity of animals. Metagenomics can be considered to have three main steps; sample collection and preparation, sequencing and finally bioinformatics. Bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic datasets is in itself a complex process, involving few standardized methodologies, thereby hampering comparison of metagenomics studies between research groups. In this publication the new bioinformatics framework MetLab is presented, aimed at providing scientists with an integrated tool for experimental design and analysis of viral metagenomes. MetLab provides support in designing the metagenomics experiment by estimating the sequencing depth needed for the complete coverage of a species. This is achieved by applying a methodology to calculate the probability of coverage using an adaptation of Stevens' theorem. It also provides scientists with several pipelines aimed at simplifying the analysis of viral metagenomes, including; quality control, assembly and taxonomic binning. We also implement a tool for simulating metagenomics datasets from several sequencing platforms. The overall aim is to provide virologists with an easy to use tool for designing, simulating and analyzing viral metagenomes. The results presented here include a benchmark towards other existing software, with emphasis on detection of viruses as well as speed of applications.

Image super-resolution (SR) task aims to recover high-resolution (HR) images from degraded low-resolution (LR) images, which has achieved great progress due to the recent advances of deep neural networks. Due to severe information loss of the LR images, it is more challenging to reconstruct high quality HR images at large scale factors, i. e., higher than 4× . Traditional reference image based SR methods usually perform patch matching to locate detailed texture from HR reference images which could provide fine details from similar image contents. But it suffers from difficulties in achieving good matching in the largely downscaled image space or feature space due to the ill-posed nature between LR and HR mapping. In this paper, we tackle this problem by exploiting fine details contained in reference HR images. Inspired by vector quantization (VQ), we propose a simple yet effective auto-encoder convolutional neural network (CNN) module to learn discrete representations of images. Furthermore, we propose to progressively learn pairs of cross-scale discrete feature representations using paired LR and HR reference images. The coarser scale of the discrete representation is responsible for encoding the global image structure while the paired finer scale of the discrete representation takes charge of capturing missing details in the finer image scale. During inference, continuous features of the test LR image are used as queries to retrieve finer scale discrete representations (value) by searching the nearest coarser scale discrete representations (key). Then, the queries and retrieved values are combined to progressively recover the HR image. Experimental results indicate that when compared with the state-of-the-art image SR models, the proposed method can achieve advanced performance in terms of both objective quality and subjective quality.

Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (F-CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance for segmentation tasks in computer vision and medical imaging. Recently, computational blocks termed squeeze and excitation (SE) have been introduced to recalibrate F-CNN feature maps both channel- and spatial-wise, boosting segmentation performance while only minimally increasing the model complexity. So far, the development of SE blocks has focused on 2D architectures. For volumetric medical images, however, 3D F-CNNs are a natural choice. In this article, we extend existing 2D recalibration methods to 3D and propose a generic compress-process-recalibrate pipeline for easy comparison of such blocks. We further introduce Project & Excite (PE) modules, customized for 3D networks. In contrast to existing modules, Project & Excite does not perform global average pooling but compresses feature maps along different spatial dimensions of the tensor separately to retain more spatial information that is subsequently used in the excitation step. We evaluate the modules on two challenging tasks, whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body segmentation of CT scans. We demonstrate that PE modules can be easily integrated into 3D F-CNNs, boosting performance up to 0.3 in Dice Score and outperforming 3D extensions of other recalibration blocks, while only marginally increasing the model complexity.

Identifying intragenic as well as intergenic sequences of the DNA, having structural alterations, is a significantly important research area, since this may be the root cause of many neurological and autoimmune diseases, including cancer. Working with whole genome NGS data has provided a new insight in this regard, but has lead to huge explosion of data that is growing exponentially. Hence, the challenges lie in efficient means of storage and processing this big data. In this study, we have developed a novel segmentation algorithm, called GenSeg, and its parallel MapReduce based algorithm, called MR-GenSeg, for detecting copy number variations. In order to annotate CNVs (variants), segments formed by GenSeg/MR-GenSeg have been represented in a novel way using a binary tree, where each node is a CNV event. GenSeg considers each position specific data of whole genome DNA sequence, so that precise identification of breakpoints is possible. GenSeg/MR-GenSeg has been compared with twelve popular CNV detection algorithms, where it has outperformed the others in terms of sensitivity, and has achieved a good F-score value. MR-GenSeg has excelled in terms of SpeedUp, when compared with these algorithms. The effect of CNVs on immunoglobulin (IG) genes has also been analysed in this study.

Deep neural network (DNN) model compression is a popular and important optimization method for efficient and fast hardware acceleration. However, the compressed model is usually fixed, without the capability to tune the computing complexity (i.e., latency in hardware) on-the-fly, depending on dynamic latency requirements, workloads, and computing hardware resource allocation. To address this challenge, dynamic DNN with run-time adaption of computing structures has been constructed through training with a cross-entropy objective function consisting of multiple subnets sampled from the supernet. Our investigations in this work show that the performance of dynamic inference highly relies on the quality of subnet sampling. To construct a dynamic DNN with multiple high-quality subnets, we propose a progressive subnetwork searching framework, which is embedded with several proposed new techniques, including trainable noise ranking, channel-group sampling, selective fine-tuning, and subnet filtering. Our proposed framework empowers the target dynamic DNN with higher accuracy for all the subnets compared with prior works on both the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research dataset with 10 classes (CIFAR-10) and ImageNet datasets. Specifically, compared with United States-Neural Network (US-NN), our method achieves 0.9% average accuracy gain for Alexnet, 2.5% for ResNet18, 1.1% for Visual Geometry Group (VGG)11, and 0.58% for MobileNetv1, on the ImageNet dataset, respectively.

Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference genome.

As the body of heterozygosity-fitness correlation (HFC) research grows, more and increasingly complicated tests have become an integral part of a typical HFC analysis (Chapman et al. 2009). Currently, no software is available to undertake conversion between the file formats required to conduct all of these tests and to conduct the main regression analyses at the core of all HFCs. Heterozygosity-Fitness Pipeline (HeFPipe) is a script written in Python that accomplishes both of these tasks for studies based on microsatellite data. HeFPipe is designed to be used from the command line terminal and will run on any Mac OSX computer. The script takes input in the form of allele reports from either the genotype-calling software, GeneMapper or GeneMarker, and reconfigures the data into GENEPOP (Raymond & Rousset 1995), Rhh (Alho et al. 2010), RMES (David et al. 2007) and GEPHAST (Amos & Acevedo-Whitehouse 2009) formats. The script is also equipped to reformat the output from GENEPOP on the Web (option 5) and Rhh into csv spreadsheets that can be incorporated into downstream analyses. HeFPipe accommodates user-provided lists of samples and markers to be included in or excluded from analyses. HeFPipe is equipped to create generalized linear models (GLMs) from both the main data set and subsets of the data. Finally, HeFPipe allows users to explore single-marker effects and conduct correlation analyses. The script, a comprehensive manual, a link to a series of video tutorials, and an example data set are available from GitHub (http://github.com/Atticus29/HeFPipe_rpos).	github.com/Atticus29/HeFPipe_rpos	https://github.com/Atticus29/HeFPipe_rpos/	Atticus29	HeFPipe_rpos			0.0	0.0		2013-09-17	2013-09-06	renamed	https://github.com/Atticus29/HeFPipe/
33831109	2021-04-08	10.1371/journal.pone.0249957	PloS one	A computational lens into how music characterizes genre in film.	Film music varies tremendously across genre in order to bring about different responses in an audience. For instance, composers may evoke passion in a romantic scene with lush string passages or inspire fear throughout horror films with inharmonious drones. This study investigates such phenomena through a quantitative evaluation of music that is associated with different film genres. We construct supervised neural network models with various pooling mechanisms to predict a film's genre from its soundtrack. We use these models to compare handcrafted music information retrieval (MIR) features against VGGish audio embedding features, finding similar performance with the top-performing architectures. We examine the best-performing MIR feature model through permutation feature importance (PFI), determining that mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and tonal features are most indicative of musical differences between genres. We investigate the interaction between musical and visual features with a cross-modal analysis, and do not find compelling evidence that music characteristic of a certain genre implies low-level visual features associated with that genre. Furthermore, we provide software code to replicate this study at https://github.com/usc-sail/mica-music-in-media. This work adds to our understanding of music's use in multi-modal contexts and offers the potential for future inquiry into human affective experiences.	github.com/usc-sail/mica-music-in-media.	https://github.com/usc-sail/mica-music-in-media/	usc-sail	mica-music-in-media			0.0	0.0		2021-04-09	2021-04-08	repo deleted	
31681437	2019-10-17	10.3389/fgene.2019.01022	Frontiers in genetics	Embracing Ambiguity in the Taxonomic Classification of Microbiome Sequencing Data.	The advent of high throughput sequencing has enabled in-depth characterization of human and environmental microbiomes. Determining the taxonomic origin of microbial sequences is one of the first, and frequently only, analysis performed on microbiome samples. Substantial research has focused on the development of methods for taxonomic annotation, often making trade-offs in computational efficiency and classification accuracy. A side-effect of these efforts has been a reexamination of the bacterial taxonomy itself. Taxonomies developed prior to the genomic revolution captured complex relationships between organisms that went beyond uniform taxonomic levels such as species, genus, and family. Driven in part by the need to simplify computational workflows, the bacterial taxonomies used most commonly today have been regularized to fit within a standard seven taxonomic levels. Consequently, modern analyses of microbial communities are relatively coarse-grained. Few methods make classifications below the genus level, impacting our ability to capture biologically relevant signals. Here, we present ATLAS, a novel strategy for taxonomic annotation that uses significant outliers within database search results to group sequences in the database into partitions. These partitions capture the extent of taxonomic ambiguity within the classification of a sample. The ATLAS pipeline can be found on GitHub [https://github.com/shahnidhi/outlier_in_BLAST_hits]. We demonstrate that ATLAS provides similar annotations to phylogenetic placement methods, but with higher computational efficiency. When applied to human microbiome data, ATLAS is able to identify previously characterized taxonomic groupings, such as those in the class  and the genus . Furthermore, the majority of partitions identified by ATLAS are at the subgenus level, replacing higher-level annotations with specific groups of species. These more precise partitions improve our detection power in determining differential abundance in microbiome association studies. 	github.com/shahnidhi/outlier_in_BLAST_hits].	https://github.com/shahnidhi/outlier_in_BLAST_hits/	shahnidhi	outlier_in_BLAST_hits			0.0	1.0	2022-06-25	2019-11-05	2019-10-17	repo deleted

N-methyladenosine (mA) is one of the most abundant forms of RNA methylation modifications currently known. It involves a wide range of biological processes, including degradation, stability, alternative splicing, etc. Therefore, the development of convenient and efficient mA prediction technologies are urgent. In this work, a novel predictor based on GBDT and stacking learning is developed to identify mA sites, which is called M6A-GSMS. To achieve accurate prediction, we explore RNA sequence information from four aspects: correlation, structure, physicochemical properties and pseudo ribonucleic acid composition. After using the GBDT algorithm for feature selection, a stacking model is constructed by combining seven basic classifiers. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results show that M6A-GSMS can obtain excellent performance for identifying the mA sites. The prediction accuracy of , , ,  and  reaches 88.4%, 60.8%, 80.5%, 92.4% and 61.8%, respectively. This method provides an effective prediction for the investigation of mA sites.

Semantic segmentation is a critical component for street understanding task in autonomous driving field. Existing various methods either focus on constructing the object's inner consistency by aggregating global or multi-scale context information, or simply combine semantic features with boundary features to refine object details. Despite impressive, most of them neglect the long-range dependences between the inner objects and boundaries. To this end, we present a Boundary Aware Network (BASeg) for semantic segmentation by exploiting boundary information as a significant cue to guide context aggregation. Specifically, a Boundary Refined Module (BRM) is proposed in the BASeg to refine coarse low-level boundary features from a Canny detector by high-level multi-scale semantic features from the backbone, and based on which, the Context Aggregation Module (CAM) is further proposed to capture long-range dependences between the boundary regions and the object inner pixels, achieving mutual gains and enhancing the intra-class consistency. Moreover, our method can be plugged into other CNN backbones for higher performance with a minor computation budget, and obtains 45.72%, 81.2%, and 77.3% of mIoU on the datasets ADE20K, Cityscapes, and CamVid, respectively.

Our knowledge of how to normalize datasets to remove latent undesirable variances has grown extensively, making for standardized data that are easily compared between studies.

CAMPP is called from a terminal command line and is supported by a user-friendly manual. The pipeline may be run on a local computer and requires little or no knowledge of programming. To avoid issues relating to R-package updates, a renv .lock file is provided to ensure R-package stability. Data-management includes missing value imputation, data normalization, and distributional checks. CAMPP performs (I) k-means clustering, (II) differential expression/abundance analysis, (III) elastic-net regression, (IV) correlation and co-expression network analyses, (V) survival analysis, and (VI) protein-protein/miRNA-gene interaction networks.

Combinatorial therapy may reduce drug side effects and improve drug efficacy, making combination therapy a promising strategy to treat complex diseases. However, in the existing computational methods, the natural properties and network knowledge of drugs have not been adequately and simultaneously considered, making it difficult to identify effective drug combinations. Computational methods that incorporate multiple sources of information (biological, chemical, pharmacological, and network knowledge) offer more opportunities to screen synergistic drug combinations. Therefore, we developed a novel Ensemble Prediction framework of Synergistic Drug Combinations (EPSDC) to accurately and efficiently predict drug combinations by integrating information from multiple-sources. EPSDC constructs feature vector of drug pair by concatenating different types of drug similarities, and then uses these groups in a feature-based base predictor. Next, transductive learning is applied on heterogeneous drug-target networks to achieve a network-based score for the drug pair. Finally, two types of ensemble rules are introduced to combine the feature-based score and the network-based score, and then potential drug combinations are prioritized. To demonstrate the effect of the ensemble rule, comprehensive experiments were conducted to compare single models and ensemble models. The experimental results indicated that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art method in five-fold cross validation and de novo prediction tests on the two benchmark datasets. We further analyzed the effect of maximum length of the meta-path and the impacts of different types of features.

"Deep learning approaches have significantly contributed to recent progress in stereo matching. These deep stereo matching methods are usually based on supervised training, which requires a large amount of high-quality ground-truth depth map annotations that are expensive to collect. Furthermore, only a limited quantity of stereo vision training data are currently available, obtained either by active sensors (Lidar and ToF cameras) or through computer graphics simulations and not meeting requirements for deep supervised training. Here, we propose a novel deep stereo approach called the ""self-supervised multiscale adversarial regression network (SMAR-Net),"" which relaxes the need for ground-truth depth maps for training. Specifically, we design a two-stage network. The first stage is a disparity regressor, in which a regression network estimates disparity values from stacked stereo image pairs. Stereo image stacking method is a novel contribution as it not only contains the spatial appearances of stereo images but also implies matching correspondences with different disparity values. In the second stage, a synthetic left image is generated based on the left-right consistency assumption. Our network is trained by minimizing a hybrid loss function composed of a content loss and an adversarial loss. The content loss minimizes the average warping error between the synthetic images and the real ones. In contrast to the generative adversarial loss, our proposed adversarial loss penalizes mismatches using multiscale features. This constrains the synthetic image and real image as being pixelwise identical instead of just belonging to the same distribution. Furthermore, the combined utilization of multiscale feature extraction in both the content loss and adversarial loss further improves the adaptability of SMAR-Net in ill-posed regions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that SMAR-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and achieves comparable outcomes to supervised methods.

Fast-developing single-cell technologies create unprecedented opportunities to reveal cell heterogeneity and diversity. Accurate classification of single cells is a critical prerequisite for recovering the mechanisms of heterogeneity. However, the scRNA-seq profiles we obtained at present have high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise, which pose challenges for existing clustering methods in grouping cells that belong to the same subpopulation based on transcriptomic profiles. Although many computational methods have been proposed developing novel and effective computational methods to accurately identify cell types remains a considerable challenge. We present a new computational framework to identify cell types by integrating low-rank representation (LRR) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF); this framework is named NMFLRR. The LRR captures the global properties of original data by using nuclear norms, and a locality constrained graph regularization term is introduced to characterize the data's local geometric information. The similarity matrix and low-dimensional features of data can be simultaneously obtained by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to handle each variable alternatively in an iterative way. We finally obtained the predicted cell types by using a spectral algorithm based on the optimized similarity matrix. Nine real scRNA-seq datasets were used to test the performance of NMFLRR and fifteen other competitive methods, and the accuracy and robustness of the simulation results suggest the NMFLRR is a promising algorithm for the classification of single cells.

Automatic coronary artery segmentation is of great value in diagnosing coronary disease. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronary artery segmentation method for coronary computerized tomography angiography (CCTA) images based on a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the segmentation, a 2D DenseNet classification network is utilized to screen out the non-coronary-artery slices. Second, we propose a coronary artery segmentation network based on the 3D-UNet, which is capable of extracting, fusing and rectifying features efficiently for accurate coronary artery segmentation. Specifically, in the encoding process of the 3D-UNet network, we adapt the dense block into the 3D-UNet so that it can extract rich and representative features for coronary artery segmentation; In the decoding process, 3D residual blocks with feature rectification capability are applied to improve the segmentation quality further. Third, we introduce a Gaussian weighting method to obtain the final segmentation results. This operation can highlight the more reliable segmentation results at the center of the 3D data blocks while weakening the less reliable segmentations at the block boundary when merging the segmentation results of spatially overlapping data blocks. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) value of 0.826 on a CCTA dataset constructed by us.

Clinical	Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy lesion and brain parenchymal segmentation from MRI using serial deep convolutional neural networks.	Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare opportunistic brain infection caused by the JC virus and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Accurate MRI assessment of PML lesion burden and brain parenchymal atrophy is of decisive value in monitoring the disease course and response to therapy. However, there are currently no validated automatic methods for quantification of PML lesion burden or associated parenchymal volume loss. Furthermore, manual brain or lesion delineations can be tedious, require the use of valuable time resources by radiologists or trained experts, and are often subjective. In this work, we introduce JCnet (named after the causative viral agent), an end-to-end, fully automated method for brain parenchymal and lesion segmentation in PML using consecutive 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks. The network architecture consists of multi-view feature pyramid networks with hierarchical residual learning blocks containing embedded batch normalization and nonlinear activation functions. The feature maps across the bottom-up and top-down pathways of the feature pyramids are merged, and an output probability membership generated through convolutional pathways, thus rendering the method fully convolutional. Our results show that this approach outperforms and improves longitudinal consistency compared to conventional, state-of-the-art methods of healthy brain and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation, utilized here as comparators given the lack of available methods validated for use in PML. The ability to produce robust and accurate automated measures of brain atrophy and lesion segmentation in PML is not only valuable clinically but holds promise toward including standardized quantitative MRI measures in clinical trials of targeted therapies.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data widely exist in bioinformatics. It is crucial to devise a distance metric for scRNA-seq data. Almost all existing clustering methods based on spectral clustering algorithms work in three separate steps: similarity graph construction; continuous labels learning; discretization of the learned labels by k-means clustering. However, this common practice has potential flaws that may lead to severe information loss and degradation of performance. Furthermore, the performance of a kernel method is largely determined by the selected kernel; a self-weighted multiple kernel learning model can help choose the most suitable kernel for scRNA-seq data. To this end, we propose to automatically learn similarity information from data. We present a new clustering method in the form of a multiple kernel combination that can directly discover groupings in scRNA-seq data. The main proposition is that automatically learned similarity information from scRNA-seq data is used to transform the candidate solution into a new solution that better approximates the discrete one. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by the standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Experiments on benchmark scRNA-Seq data validate the superior performance of the proposed model.

Fast and accurate modelling of flood inundation has gained increasing attention in recent years. One approach gaining popularity recently is the development of emulation models using data driven methods, such as artificial neural networks. These emulation models are often developed to model flood depth for each grid cell in the modelling domain in order to maintain accurate spatial representation of the flood inundation surface. This leads to redundancy in modelling, as well as difficulties in achieving good model performance across floodplains where there are limited data available. In this paper, a spatial reduction and reconstruction (SRR) method is developed to (1) identify representative locations within the model domain where water levels can be used to represent flood inundation surface using deep learning models; and (2) reconstruct the flood inundation surface based on water levels simulated at these representative locations. The SRR method is part of the SRR-Deep-Learning framework for flood inundation modelling and therefore, it needs to be used together with data driven models.

A confounding factor is an unstudied factor that affects one or more of the variables that are being studied in an investigation, so the presence of a confounder may lead to inaccurate or biased results. It is well recognized that physiological and environmental factors such as race, diet, age, gender, blood pressure, and diurnal cycle affect mammalian metabolism. To eliminate the noise introduced by confounders into metabolomics studies, a GUI-based method denoted metabolic confounding effect elimination (MCEE) was developed and has since been applied successfully in a wide range of metabolomics studies. To keep up with recent developments in computational metabolomics and a growing number of user requests, an upgraded version of MCEE with more options and enhanced performance was designed and developed. Besides the generalized linear model (GLM) method, a multivariate method for selecting affected metabolites-canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-was introduced, which accounts for complicated correlations and collinearity within the metabolome. Multiple confounders are acceptable and can be identified and processed separately or simultaneously. The effectiveness of this new version of MCEE as well as the pros and cons of the two methodological options were examined using three simulated data sets (a basic model, a model with different sample size ratios, and a sparse model) and two real-world data sets (a human type 2 diabetes mellitus data set and a human arthritis data set).

23272111	2012-12-14	10.1371/journal.pone.0051511	PloS one	MultiMetEval: comparative and multi-objective analysis of genome-scale metabolic models.	Comparative metabolic modelling is emerging as a novel field, supported by the development of reliable and standardized approaches for constructing genome-scale metabolic models in high throughput. New software solutions are needed to allow efficient comparative analysis of multiple models in the context of multiple cellular objectives. Here, we present the user-friendly software framework Multi-Metabolic Evaluator (MultiMetEval), built upon SurreyFBA, which allows the user to compose collections of metabolic models that together can be subjected to flux balance analysis. Additionally, MultiMetEval implements functionalities for multi-objective analysis by calculating the Pareto front between two cellular objectives. Using a previously generated dataset of 38 actinobacterial genome-scale metabolic models, we show how these approaches can lead to exciting novel insights. Firstly, after incorporating several pathways for the biosynthesis of natural products into each of these models, comparative flux balance analysis predicted that species like Streptomyces that harbour the highest diversity of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes do not necessarily have the metabolic network topology most suitable for compound overproduction. Secondly, multi-objective analysis of biomass production and natural product biosynthesis in these actinobacteria shows that the well-studied occurrence of discrete metabolic switches during the change of cellular objectives is inherent to their metabolic network architecture. Comparative and multi-objective modelling can lead to insights that could not be obtained by normal flux balance analyses.

Post Translational Modification (PTM) is defined as the modification of amino acids along the protein sequences after the translation process. These modifications significantly impact on the functioning of proteins. Therefore, having a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism of PTMs turns out to be critical in studying the biological roles of proteins. Among a wide range of PTMs, sumoylation is one of the most important modifications due to its known cellular functions which include transcriptional regulation, protein stability, and protein subcellular localization. Despite its importance, determining sumoylation sites via experimental methods is time-consuming and costly. This has led to a great demand for the development of fast computational methods able to accurately determine sumoylation sites in proteins. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based method for predicting sumoylation sites called SumSec. To do this, we employed the predicted secondary structure of amino acids to extract two types of structural features from neighboring amino acids along the protein sequence which has never been used for this task. As a result, our proposed method is able to enhance the sumoylation site prediction task, outperforming previously proposed methods in the literature.

Long non-coding RNA(lncRNA) is one of the non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides and it has no protein encoding function. LncRNA plays a key role in many biological processes. Studying the RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites on the lncRNA chain helps to reveal epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms, to explore the physiological and pathological processes of cancer, and to discover new therapeutic breakthroughs. To improve the recognition rate of RBP binding sites and reduce the experimental time and cost, many calculation methods based on domain knowledge to predict RBP binding sites have emerged. However, these prediction methods are independent of nucleotides and do not take into account nucleotide statistics. In this paper, we use a high-order statistical-based encoding scheme, then the encoded lncRNA sequences are fed into a hybrid deep learning architecture named AC-Caps. It consists of a joint processing layer(composed of attention mechanism and convolutional neural network) and a capsule network. The AC-Caps model was evaluated using 31 independent experimental data sets from 12 lncRNA-binding proteins. In experiments, our method achieves excellent performance, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.967 and an average accuracy (ACC) of 92.5%, which are 0.014, 2.3%, 0.261, 28.9%, 0.189, and 21.8% higher than HOCCNNLB, iDeepS, and DeepBind, respectively. The results show that the AC-Caps method can reliably process the large-scale RBP binding site data on the lncRNA chain, and the prediction performance is better than existing deep-learning models.

Benign and malignant classification of clustered microcalcifications (MCs) in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an essential task in computer-aided diagnosis. However, due to the anisotropic resolution of DBT, three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods cannot extract hierarchical features efficiently. Moreover, the sparse distribution of MC points in the cluster makes it difficult for the CNN to extract discriminative structural information for classification. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a novel structure-aware hierarchical network (SAH-Net) for benign and malignant classification of clustered MC in a DBT volume. Specifically, the two-dimensional (2-D) group convolution is used to extract intraslice features. The one-to-one correspondence between group convolutions and slices ensures the independence of hierarchical feature extraction. Then, a partial deformable Transformer-based 3-D structural feature learning module is proposed to capture the long-range dependency between MC points in the cluster. We evaluate the proposed method on an in-house dataset with 495 clustered MCs collected from 462 DBT images. Experimental results confirm the validity of our proposed modules. The results also show that the proposed SAH-Net outperforms several other representative methods on this topic, and achieves the best classification result, with an area under the receiver operation curve (AUC) of 86.87%.

Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 disease is still rising and techniques to either diagnose or evaluate the disease are still thoroughly investigated. The use of CT as a complementary tool to other biological tests is still under scrutiny as the CT scans are prone to many false positives as other lung diseases display similar characteristics on CT scans. However, fully investigating CT images is of tremendous interest to better understand the disease progression and therefore thousands of scans need to be segmented by radiologists to study infected areas. Over the last year, many deep learning models for segmenting CT-lungs were developed. Unfortunately, the lack of large and shared annotated multicentric datasets led to models that were either under-tested (small dataset) or not properly compared (own metrics, none shared dataset), often leading to poor generalization performance. To address, these issues, we developed a model that uses a multiscale and multilevel feature extraction strategy for COVID19 segmentation and extensively validated it on several datasets to assess its generalization capability for other segmentation tasks on similar organs. The proposed model uses a novel encoder and decoder with a proposed kernel-based atrous spatial pyramid pooling module that is used at the bottom of the model to extract small features with a multistage skip connection concatenation approach. The results proved that our proposed model could be applied on a small-scale dataset and still produce generalizable performances on other segmentation tasks. The proposed model produced an efficient Dice score of 90% on a 100 cases dataset, 95% on the NSCLC dataset, 88.49% on the COVID19 dataset, and 97.33 on the StructSeg 2019 dataset as compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

26191646	2015-06-12	10.1111/jmi.12266	Journal of microscopy	Automated tracing of myelinated axons and detection of the nodes of Ranvier in serial images of peripheral nerves.	The development of realistic neuroanatomical models of peripheral nerves for simulation purposes requires the reconstruction of the morphology of the myelinated fibres in the nerve, including their nodes of Ranvier. Currently, this information has to be extracted by semimanual procedures, which severely limit the scalability of the experiments. In this contribution, we propose a supervised machine learning approach for the detailed reconstruction of the geometry of fibres inside a peripheral nerve based on its high-resolution serial section images. Learning from sparse expert annotations, the algorithm traces myelinated axons, even across the nodes of Ranvier. The latter are detected automatically. The approach is based on classifying the myelinated membranes in a supervised fashion, closing the membrane gaps by solving an assignment problem, and classifying the closed gaps for the nodes of Ranvier detection. The algorithm has been validated on two very different datasets: (i) rat vagus nerve subvolume, SBFSEM microscope, 200 × 200 × 200 nm resolution, (ii) rat sensory branch subvolume, confocal microscope, 384 × 384 × 800 nm resolution. For the first dataset, the algorithm correctly reconstructed 88% of the axons (241 out of 273) and achieved 92% accuracy on the task of Ranvier node detection. For the second dataset, the gap closing algorithm correctly closed 96.2% of the gaps, and 55% of axons were reconstructed correctly through the whole volume. On both datasets, training the algorithm on a small data subset and applying it to the full dataset takes a fraction of the time required by the currently used semiautomated protocols.

Previous methods on text image motion deblurring seldom consider the sparse characteristics of the blur kernel. This paper proposes a new text image motion deblurring method by exploiting the sparse properties of both text image itself and kernel. It incorporates the L  -norm for regularizing the blur kernel in the deblurring model, besides the L  sparse priors for the text image and its gradient. Such a L  -norm-based model is efficiently optimized by half-quadratic splitting coupled with the fast conjugate descent method. To further improve the quality of the recovered kernel, a structure-preserving kernel denoising method is also developed to filter out the noisy pixels, yielding a clean kernel curve.

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide illness caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Owing to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, numerous traditional strategies for developing novel alternative therapies have been presented. The effectiveness and dependability of these procedures are not always consistent. Peptide-based therapy has recently been regarded as a preferable alternative due to its excellent selectivity in targeting specific cells without affecting the normal cells. However, due to the rapid growth of the peptide samples, predicting TB accurately has become a challenging task. To effectively identify antitubercular peptides, an intelligent and reliable prediction model is indispensable. An ensemble learning approach was used in this study to improve expected results by compensating for the shortcomings of individual classification algorithms. Initially, three distinct representation approaches were used to formulate the training samples: k-space amino acid composition, composite physiochemical properties, and one-hot encoding. The feature vectors of the applied feature extraction methods are then combined to generate a heterogeneous vector. Finally, utilizing individual and heterogeneous vectors, five distinct nature classification models were used to evaluate prediction rates. In addition, a genetic algorithm-based ensemble model was used to improve the suggested model's prediction and training capabilities. Using Training and independent datasets, the proposed ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 94.47% and 92.68%, respectively. It was observed that our proposed ""iAtbP-Hyb-EnC"" model outperformed and reported ~10% highest training accuracy than existing predictors. The ""iAtbP-Hyb-EnC"" model is suggested to be a reliable tool for scientists and might play a valuable role in academic research and drug discovery.

35529153	2019-10-16	10.1039/c9ra06133a	RSC advances	NCPCDA: network consistency projection for circRNA-disease association prediction.	A growing body of evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a pivotal role in various biological processes and have a close association with the initiation and progression of diseases. Moreover, circRNAs are considered as promising biomarkers for disease diagnosis owing to their characteristics of conservation, stability and universality. Inferring disease-circRNA relationships will contribute to the understanding of disease pathology. However, it is costly and laborious to discover novel disease-circRNA interactions by wet-lab experiments, and few computational methods have been devoted to predicting potential circRNAs for diseases. Here, we advance a computational method (NCPCDA) to identify novel circRNA-disease associations based on network consistency projection. For starters, we make use of multi-view similarity data, including circRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and association profile similarity, to construct the integrated circRNA similarity and disease similarity. Then, we project circRNA space and disease space on the circRNA-disease interaction network, respectively. Finally, we can obtain the predicted circRNA-disease association score matrix by combining the above two space projection scores. Simulation results show that NCPCDA can efficiently infer disease-circRNA relationships with high accuracy, obtaining AUCs of 0.9541 and 0.9201 in leave-one-out cross validation and five-fold cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, case studies also suggest that NCPCDA is promising for discovering new disease-circRNA interactions.

Breast cancer, the most common invasive cancer, causes deaths of thousands of women in the world every year. Early detection of the same is a remedy to lessen the death rate. Hence, screening of breast cancer in its early stage is utmost required. However, in the developing nations not many can afford the screening and detection procedures owing to its cost. Hence, an effective and less expensive way of detecting breast cancer is performed using thermography which, unlike other methods, can be used on women of various ages. To this end, we propose a computer aided breast cancer detection system that accepts thermal breast images to detect the same. Here, we use the pre-trained DenseNet121 model as a feature extractor to build a classifier for the said purpose. Before extracting features, we work on the original thermal breast images to get outputs using two edge detectors - Prewitt and Roberts. These two edge-maps along with the original image make the input to the DenseNet121 model as a 3-channel image. The thermal breast image dataset namely, Database for Mastology Research (DMR-IR) is used to evaluate performance of our model. We achieve the highest classification accuracy of 98.80% on the said database, which outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed model.

We describe here a crowdsourcing workflow for extracting chemical-induced disease relations from free text as part of the BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation challenge. Five non-expert workers on the CrowdFlower platform were shown each potential chemical-induced disease relation highlighted in the original source text and asked to make binary judgments about whether the text supported the relation. Worker responses were aggregated through voting, and relations receiving four or more votes were predicted as true.

LncRNA and miRNA are two non-coding RNA types that are popular in current research. LncRNA interacts with miRNA to regulate gene transcription, further affecting human health and disease. Accurate identification of lncRNA-miRNA interactions contributes to the in-depth study of the biological functions and mechanisms of non-coding RNA. However, relying on biological experiments to obtain interaction information is time-consuming and expensive. Considering the rapid accumulation of gene information and the few computational methods, it is urgent to supplement the effective computational models to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous graph inference method based on similarity network fusion (SNFHGILMI) to predict potential lncRNA-miRNA interactions. First, we calculated multiple similarity data, including lncRNA sequence similarity, miRNA sequence similarity, lncRNA Gaussian nuclear similarity, and miRNA Gaussian nuclear similarity. Second, the similarity network fusion method was employed to integrate the data and get the similarity network of lncRNA and miRNA. Then, we constructed a bipartite network by combining the known interaction network and similarity network of lncRNA and miRNA. Finally, the heterogeneous graph inference method was introduced to construct a prediction model. On the real dataset, the model SNFHGILMI achieved AUC of 0.9501 and 0.9426 ± 0.0035 based on LOOCV and 5-fold cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, case studies also demonstrate that SNFHGILMI is a high-performance prediction method that can accurately predict new lncRNA-miRNA interactions.

Discovery of robust diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers is a key to optimizing therapeutic benefit for select patient cohorts - an idea commonly referred to as precision medicine. Most discovery studies to derive such markers from high-dimensional transcriptomics datasets are weakly powered with sample sizes in the tens of patients. Therefore, highly regularized statistical approaches are essential to making generalizable predictions. At the same time, prior knowledge-driven approaches have been successfully applied to the manual interpretation of high-dimensional transcriptomics datasets. In this work, we assess the impact of combining two orthogonal approaches for the discovery of biomarker signatures, namely (1) well-known lasso-based regression approaches and its more recent derivative, the group lasso, and (2) the discovery of significant upstream regulators in literature-derived biological networks. Our method integrates both approaches in a weighted group-lasso model and differentially weights gene sets based on inferred active regulatory mechanism. Using nested cross-validation as well as independent clinical datasets, we demonstrate that our approach leads to increased accuracy and generalizable results. We implement our approach in a computationally efficient, user-friendly R package called creNET.

"Expectation maximization (EM) is a technique for estimating maximum-likelihood parameters of a latent variable model given observed data by alternating between taking expectations of sufficient statistics, and maximizing the expected log likelihood. For situations where sufficient statistics are intractable, stochastic approximation EM (SAEM) is often used, which uses Monte Carlo techniques to approximate the expected log likelihood. Two common implementations of SAEM, Batch EM (BEM) and online EM (OEM), are parameterized by a ""learning rate"", and their efficiency depend strongly on this parameter. We propose an extension to the OEM algorithm, termed Introspective Online Expectation Maximization (IOEM), which removes the need for specifying this parameter by adapting the learning rate to trends in the parameter updates. We show that our algorithm matches the efficiency of the optimal BEM and OEM algorithms in multiple models, and that the efficiency of IOEM can exceed that of BEM/OEM methods with optimal learning rates when the model has many parameters. Finally we use IOEM to fit two models to a financial time series.

The ability to anticipate future actions of humans is useful in application areas such as automated driving, robot-assisted manufacturing, and smart homes. These applications require representing and anticipating human actions involving the use of objects. Existing methods that use human-object interactions for anticipation require object affordance labels for every relevant object in the scene that match the ongoing action. Hence, we propose to represent every pairwise human-object (HO) interaction using only their visual features. Next, we use cross-correlation to capture the second-order statistics across human-object pairs in a frame. Cross-correlation produces a holistic representation of the frame that can also handle a variable number of human-object pairs in every frame of the observation period. We show that cross-correlation based frame representation is more suited for action anticipation than attention-based and other second-order approaches. Furthermore, we observe that using a transformer model for temporal aggregation of frame-wise HO representations results in better action anticipation than other temporal networks. So, we propose two approaches for constructing an end-to-end trainable multi-modal transformer (MM-Transformer; code at https://github.com/debadityaroy/MM-Transformer_ActAnt) model that combines the evidence across spatio-temporal, motion, and HO representations. We show the performance of MM-Transformer on procedural datasets like 50 Salads and Breakfast, and an unscripted dataset like EPIC-KITCHENS55. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of human-object representation and MM-Transformers is effective even for long-term anticipation.	github.com/debadityaroy/MM-Transformer_ActAnt	https://github.com/debadityaroy/MM-Transformer_ActAnt/	debadityaroy	MM-Transformer_ActAnt			0.0	0.0		2021-09-23	2021-09-23	repo deleted

It has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) the novel coronavirus a global pandemic due to an exponential spread in COVID-19 in the past months reaching over 100 million cases and resulting in approximately 3 million deaths worldwide. Amid this pandemic, identification of cyberbullying has become a more evolving area of research over posts or comments in social media platforms. In multilingual societies like India, code-switched texts comprise the majority of the Internet. Identifying the online bullying of the code-switched user is bit challenging than monolingual cases. As a first step towards enabling the development of approaches for cyberbullying detection, we developed a new code-switched dataset, collected from Twitter utterances annotated with binary labels. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed dataset, we build different machine learning (Support Vector Machine & Logistic Regression) and deep learning (Multilayer Perceptron, Convolution Neural Network, BiLSTM, BERT) algorithms to detect cyberbullying of English-Hindi (En-Hi) code-switched text. Our proposed model integrates different hand-crafted features and is enriched by sequential and semantic patterns generated by different state-of-the-art deep neural network models. Initial experimental results of the proposed deep ensemble model on our code-switched data reveal that our approach yields state-of-the-art results, i.e., 0.93 in terms of macro-averaged F1 score.

Retinal blood vessel morphological abnormalities are generally associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and systemic diseases, automatic artery/vein (A/V) classification is particularly important for medical image analysis and clinical decision making. However, the current method still has some limitations in A/V classification, especially the blood vessel edge and end error problems caused by the single scale and the blurred boundary of the A/V. To alleviate these problems, in this work, we propose a vessel-constraint network (VC-Net) that utilizes the information of vessel distribution and edge to enhance A/V classification, which is a high-precision A/V classification model based on data fusion. Particularly, the VC-Net introduces a vessel-constraint (VC) module that combines local and global vessel information to generate a weight map to constrain the A/V features, which suppresses the background-prone features and enhances the edge and end features of blood vessels. In addition, the VC-Net employs a multiscale feature (MSF) module to extract blood vessel information with different scales to improve the feature extraction capability and robustness of the model. And the VC-Net can get vessel segmentation results simultaneously. The proposed method is tested on publicly available fundus image datasets with different scales, namely, DRIVE, LES, and HRF, and validated on two newly created multicenter datasets: Tongren and Kailuan. We achieve a balance accuracy of 0.9554 and F1 scores of 0.7616 and 0.7971 for the arteries and veins, respectively, on the DRIVE dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed model achieves competitive performance in A/V classification and vessel segmentation tasks compared with state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we test the Kailuan dataset with other trained fusion datasets, the results also show good robustness.

34999162	2022-01-07	10.1016/j.mri.2022.01.004	Magnetic resonance imaging	Generalizing deep learning brain segmentation for skull removal and intracranial measurements.	Total intracranial volume (TICV) and posterior fossa volume (PFV) are essential covariates for brain volumetric analyses with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Detailed whole brain segmentation provides a non-invasive way to measure brain regions. Furthermore, increasing neuroimaging data are distributed in a skull-stripped manner for privacy protection. Therefore, generalizing deep learning brain segmentation for skull removal and intracranial measurements is an appealing task. However, data availability is challenging due to a limited set of manually traced atlases with whole brain and TICV/PFV labels. In this paper, we employ U-Net tiles to achieve automatic TICV estimation and whole brain segmentation simultaneously on brains w/and w/o the skull. To overcome the scarcity of manually traced whole brain volumes, a transfer learning method is introduced to estimate additional TICV and PFV labels during whole brain segmentation in T1-weighted MRI. Specifically, U-Net tiles are first pre-trained using large-scale BrainCOLOR atlases without TICV and PFV labels, which are created by multi-atlas segmentation. Then the pre-trained models are refined by training the additional TICV and PFV labels using limited BrainCOLOR atlases. We also extend our method to handle skull-stripped brain MR images. From the results, our method provides promising whole brain segmentation and volume estimation results for both brains w/and w/o skull in terms of mean Dice similarity coefficients and mean surface distance and absolute volume similarity.

The interaction between proteins and RNA is closely related to various human diseases. Computer-aided drug design can be facilitated by detecting the RNA sites that bind proteins. However, due to the aggregation of binding sites in RNA sequences, high sample similarity occurs when extracting RNA fragments by using a sliding window. Considering these problems, we present a method, DFpin, to predict protein-interacting nucleotides in RNA. To retain more key nucleotide sites, we used the redundancy method based on feature similarity, that is, feature redundancy is removed based on the RNA mono-nucleotide composition to maintain the diversity of RNA samples and avoid the residue of redundant data. In addition, to extract key abstract features and avoid over-ﬁtting, we used the cascade structure of a deep forest model to predict protein-interacting nucleotides. Overall, DFpin demonstrated excellent classiﬁcation with 85.4% accuracy and 93.3% area under the curve. Compared with other methods, the accuracy of DFpin was better, suggesting that feature-based redundancy removal and deep forest can help predict nucleotides of protein interactions.

Conventional networks for object skeleton detection are usually hand-crafted. Despite the effectiveness, hand-crafted network architectures lack the theoretical basis and require intensive prior knowledge to implement representation complementarity for objects/parts in different granularity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive linear span network (AdaLSN), driven by neural architecture search (NAS), to automatically configure and integrate scale-aware features for object skeleton detection. AdaLSN is formulated with the theory of linear span, which provides one of the earliest explanations for multi-scale deep feature fusion. AdaLSN is materialized by defining a mixed unit-pyramid search space, which goes beyond many existing search spaces using unit-level or pyramid-level features. Within the mixed space, we apply genetic architecture search to jointly optimize unit-level operations and pyramid-level connections for adaptive feature space expansion. AdaLSN substantiates its versatility by achieving significantly higher accuracy and latency trade-off compared with the state-of-the-arts. It also demonstrates general applicability to image-to-mask tasks such as edge detection and road extraction.

Combinatorial drug therapy is a promising way for treating cancers, which can reduce drug side effects and improve drug efficacy. However, due to the large-scale combinatorial space, it is difficult to quickly and effectively identify novel synergistic drug combinations for further implementing combinatorial drug therapy. The computational method of fusing multi-source knowledge is a time- and cost-efficient strategy to infer synergistic drug combinations for testing. However, for the existing computational methods of inferring synergistic drug combinations, it still remains a challenging to effectively combine multi-source information to achieve the desired results. Hence, in this study, we developed a novel Inference method of Synergistic Drug Combinations based on Symmetric Meta-Path (ISDCSMP), which can systematically and accurately prioritize synergistic drug combinations in a novel drug-target heterogeneous network integrating multi-source information. In the experiment, ISDCSMP outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC and precision on the benchmark dataset in five-fold cross validation. Moreover, we further illustrated performances of different ways for obtaining the combination coefficients, and analyzed the influences of the maximum meta-path length.

34430072	2021-08-04	10.7717/peerj.11581	PeerJ	iSUMOK-PseAAC: prediction of lysine sumoylation sites using statistical moments and Chou's PseAAC.	Sumoylation is the post-translational modification that is involved in the adaption of the cells and the functional properties of a large number of proteins. Sumoylation has key importance in subcellular concentration, transcriptional synchronization, chromatin remodeling, response to stress, and regulation of mitosis. Sumoylation is associated with developmental defects in many human diseases such as cancer, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Spin cerebellar ataxia 1, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The covalent bonding of Sumoylation is essential to inheriting part of the operative characteristics of some other proteins. For that reason, the prediction of the Sumoylation site has significance in the scientific community. A novel and efficient technique is proposed to predict the Sumoylation sites in proteins by incorporating Chou's Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) with statistical moments-based features. The outcomes from the proposed system using 10 fold cross-validation testing are 94.51%, 94.24%, 94.79% and 0.8903% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. The performance of the proposed system is so far the best in comparison to the other state-of-the-art methods.

Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has become an indispensable component of modern molecular and cellular biochemistry analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is one of the most well-established MS techniques for molecule detection and quantification. Despite its wide usage, there lacks an accurate computational framework to analyze MRM data, and expert annotation is often required, especially to perform peak integration. Here we propose a deep learning method PB-Net (Peak Boundary Neural Network), built upon recent advances in sequential neural networks, for fully automatic chromatographic peak integration. To train PB-Net, we generated a large dataset of over 170,000 expert annotated peaks from MS transitions spanning a wide dynamic range, including both peptides and intact glycopeptides. Our model demonstrated outstanding performances on unseen test samples, reaching near-perfect agreement (Pearson's r 0.997) with human annotated ground truth. Systematic evaluations also show that PB-Net is substantially more robust and accurate compared to previous state-of-the-art peak integration software. PB-Net can benefit the wide community of mass spectrometry data analysis, especially in applications involving high-throughput MS experiments. Codes and test data used in this work are available at https://github.com/miaecle/PB-net. SIGNIFICANCE: Human annotations serve an important role in accurate quantification of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments, though they are costly to collect and limit analysis throughput. In this work we proposed and developed a novel technique for the peak-integration step in MRM, based on recent innovations in sequential deep learning models. We collected in total 170,000 expert-annotated MRM peaks and trained a set of accurate and robust neural networks for the task. Results demonstrated a substantial improvement over the current state-of-the-art software for mass spectrometry analysis and comparable level of accuracy and precision as human annotators.	github.com/miaecle/PB-net.	https://github.com/miaecle/PB-net/	miaecle	PB-net			0.0	0.0		2020-05-18	2020-05-13	repo deleted

"Ligand enrichment assessment based on benchmarking data sets has become a necessity for the rational selection of the best-suited approach for prospective data mining of drug-like molecules. Up to now, a variety of benchmarking data sets had been generated and frequently used. Among them, MUBD-HDACs from our prior research efforts was regarded as one of five state-of-the-art benchmarks in 2017 by Frontiers in Pharmacology. This benchmarking set was generated by one of our unique de-biasing algorithms. It also rendered quite a few other cases of successful applications in recent years, thus is expected to have more impact in modern drug discovery. To make our algorithm amenable to more users, we developed a Python GUI application called MUBD-DecoyMaker 2.0. Moreover, it has two new additional functional modules, i. e. ""Detect 2D Bias"" and ""Quality Control"". This new GUI version had been proved to be easy to use while generate benchmarking data sets of the same quality.

Lysine malonylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs). It affects the functionality of cells. Malonylation site prediction in proteins can unfold the mechanisms of cellular functionalities. Experimental methods are one of the due prediction approaches. But they are typically costly and time-consuming to implement. Recently, methods based on machine-learning solutions have been proposed to tackle this problem. Such practices have been shown to reduce costs and time complexities and increase accuracy. However, these approaches also have specific shortcomings, including inappropriate feature extraction out of protein sequences, high-dimensional features, and inefficient underlying classifiers. A machine learning-based method is proposed in this paper to cope with these problems. In the proposed approach, seven different features are extracted. Then, the extracted features are combined, ranked based on the Fisher's score (F-score), and the most efficient ones are selected. Afterward, malonylation sites are predicted using various classifiers. Simulation results show that the proposed method has acceptable performance compared with some state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the XGBOOST classifier, founded on extracted features such as TFCRF, has a higher prediction rate than the other methods.

35323892	2022-05-13	10.1093/bib/bbac058	Briefings in bioinformatics	A knowledge-driven network for fine-grained relationship detection between miRNA and disease.	Increasing biological evidence indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in exploring the pathogenesis of various human diseases (especially in tumors). Mining disease-related miRNAs is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Compared with the traditional experimental methods with the significant limitations of high cost, long cycle and small scale, the methods based on computing have the advantages of being cost-effective. However, although the current methods based on computational biology can accurately predict the correlation between miRNAs and disease, they can not predict the detailed association information at a fine level. We propose a knowledge-driven approach to the fine-grained prediction of disease-related miRNAs (KDFGMDA). Different from the previous methods, this method can finely predict the clear associations between miRNA and disease, such as upregulation, downregulation or dysregulation. Specifically, KDFGMDA extracts triple information from massive experimental data and existing datasets to construct a knowledge graph and then trains a depth graph representation learning model based on knowledge graph to complete fine-grained prediction tasks. Experimental results show that KDFGMDA can predict the relationship between miRNA and disease accurately, which is of far-reaching significance for medical clinical research and early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. Additionally, the results of case studies on three types of cancers, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and expression difference analysis further provide the effectiveness and feasibility of KDFGMDA to detect potential candidate miRNAs.

35753591	2022-06-23	10.1016/j.ymeth.2022.06.005	Methods (San Diego, Calif.)	PDSM-LGCN: Prediction of drug sensitivity associated microRNAs via light graph convolution neural network.	Cancer has become one of the critical diseases threatening human life and health. The sensitivity difference of cancer drugs has always been a critical cause of the treatment come to nothing. Once drug resistance occurs, it will make the anticancer treatment or even various drugs ineffective. With the deepening of cancer research, a growing number of evidence shows that microRNA has a particular regulatory effect on the sensitivity of cancer drugs, which provides new research ideas. However, using traditional biological experiments to verify and discover the relations of microRNA-drug sensitivity is cumbersome and time-consuming, significantly slowing down cancer drug sensitivity's research progress. Therefore, this paper proposes a computational method (PDSM-LGCN) that spreads information through the high-order connection between cancer drug sensitivity and microRNA. At the same time, the model constructs an optimized-GCN as an embedding propagation layer to obtain the practical embeddings of microRNA and medicines. Finally, based on a collaborative filtering algorithm, the model brings the prediction score between microRNA and drug sensitivity. The results of fivefold cross-validation show that the AUC of PDSM-LGCN is 0.8872, and the AUPR is as high as 0.9026. At the same time, we also reproduced the five latest models of similar problems and compared the results. Our model has the best comprehensive effect among them. In addition, the reliability of PDSM-LGCN was further confirmed through the case study of Cisplatin and Doxorubicin, which can be used as a powerful tool for clinical and biological research.

Clinically oriented deep learning algorithms, combined with large-scale medical datasets, have significantly promoted computer-aided diagnosis. To address increasing ethical and privacy issues, Federated Learning (FL) adopts a distributed paradigm to collaboratively train models, rather than collecting samples from multiple institutions for centralized training. Despite intensive research on FL, two major challenges are still existing when applying FL in the real-world medical scenarios, including the performance degradation (i.e., retrogress) after each communication and the intractable class imbalance. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework to tackle these two problems. For the retrogress problem, we first devise a Progressive Fourier Aggregation (PFA) at the server side to gradually integrate parameters of client models in the frequency domain. Then, at the client side, we design a Deputy-Enhanced Transfer (DET) to smoothly transfer global knowledge to the personalized local model. For the class imbalance problem, we propose the Conjoint Prototype-Aligned (CPA) loss to facilitate the balanced optimization of the FL framework. Considering the inaccessibility of private local data to other participants in FL, the CPA loss calculates the global conjoint objective based on global imbalance, and then adjusts the client-side local training through the prototype-aligned refinement to eliminate the imbalance gap with such a balanced goal. Extensive experiments are performed on real-world dermoscopic and prostate MRI FL datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our FL framework in real-world medical scenarios, by outperforming state-of-the-art FL methods with a large margin.

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based de novo peptide sequencing is a powerful method for high-throughput protein analysis. However, the explosively increasing size of MS/MS spectra dataset inevitably and exponentially raises the computational demand of existing de novo peptide sequencing methods, which is an issue urgently to be solved in computational biology. This paper introduces an efficient tool based on SW26010 many-core processor, namely SWPepNovo, to process the large-scale peptide MS/MS spectra using a parallel peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) algorithm. Our design employs a two-level parallelization mechanism: (1) the task-level parallelism between MPEs using MPI based on a data transformation method and a dynamic feedback task scheduling algorithm, (2) the thread-level parallelism across CPEs using asynchronous task transfer and multithreading. Moreover, three optimization strategies, including vectorization, double buffering and memory access optimizations, have been employed to overcome both the compute-bound and the memory-bound bottlenecks in the parallel PSMs algorithm. The results of experiments conducted on multiple spectra datasets demonstrate the performance of SWPepNovo against three state-of-the-art tools for peptide sequencing, including PepNovo+, PEAKS and DeepNovo-DIA.

[OrderedDict([('@Label', 'UNLABELLED'), ('#text', 'At specific genomic loci, miRNAs are in clusters and their association with copy number variations (CNVs) may exhibit abnormal expression in several cancers.

To achieve this, we used extensive bioinformatics resources and performed an integrated analysis of recurrent CNVs, clustered miRNA expression, gene expression, and drug-gene interaction datasets. The study identified nine upregulated miRNA clusters that are residing on CNV gain regions and three miRNA clusters (hsa-mir-200c/mir-141, hsa-mir-216a/mir-217, and hsa-mir-15b/mir-16-2) are correlated with patient survival.

Research on pathological diagnosis of hematopoietic disorders based on bone marrow aspirate smear images has attracted more and more attention with the development of deep learning methods. However, high quality bone marrow aspirate smear image datasets are not readily available because of the time, the efforts, and the medical knowledge required in the acquisition and manual annotation images. In order to facilitate the research of automated diagnosis of hematological disorders, we constructed a high quality Bone Marrow Aspirate Smear Image Dataset (BMASID), which contains 230 bone marrow aspirate smear images, all with the corresponding labeled images. We used additional clinical images as testing data, which are more challenging because of image noise, cell overlap, cell adhesion, blurred borders of cells and ambiguous types of cells. We also proposed a Cell Recognition Network (CRNet) that was trained on this benchmark dataset. CRNet is comprised of a cell detector to locate and recognize cells in the bone marrow aspirate images, and a cell classifier to classify the types of cells. New anchors and novel evaluation metrics are proposed and applied in CRNet. Benchmark evaluations of the proposed CRNet demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the detection precision by detector is more than 83%, and it is better when compared with other detection methods. After the cell type confirmation by the cell classifier, the precision is more than 95%. Compared with the most popular evaluation metrics Intersection over Union (IoU) and the newly proposed Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) used in the object detection benchmarks, our evaluation metrics are more suitable for the cell detection task with ambiguous cell boundaries.

Proteins play their vital role in biological systems through interaction and complex formation with other biological molecules. Indeed, abnormalities in the interaction patterns affect the proteins' structure and have detrimental effects on living organisms. Research in structure prediction gains its gravity as the functions of proteins depend on their structures. Protein-protein docking is one of the computational methods devised to understand the interaction between proteins. Metaheuristic algorithms are promising to use owing to the hardness of the structure prediction problem. In this paper, a variant of the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is applied to get an accurate protein-protein complex structure. The algorithm begins execution from a randomly generated initial population, which gets flourished in different isolated islands, trying to find their local optimum. The abiotic and biotic pollination applied in different generations brings diversity and intensity to the solutions.

Vision-based fire detection systems have been significantly improved by deep models; however, higher numbers of false alarms and a slow inference speed still hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. For a balanced trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, we introduce dual fire attention network (DFAN) to achieve effective yet efficient fire detection. The first attention mechanism highlights the most important channels from the features of an existing backbone model, yielding significantly emphasized feature maps. Then, a modified spatial attention mechanism is employed to capture spatial details and enhance the discrimination potential of fire and non-fire objects. We further optimize the DFAN for real-world applications by discarding a significant number of extra parameters using a meta-heuristic approach, which yields around 50% higher FPS values. Finally, we contribute a medium-scale challenging fire classification dataset by considering extremely diverse, highly similar fire/non-fire images and imbalanced classes, among many other complexities. The proposed dataset advances the traditional fire detection datasets by considering multiple classes to answer the following question: what is on fire? We perform experiments on four widely used fire detection datasets, and the DFAN provides the best results compared to 21 state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, our research provides a baseline for fire detection over edge devices with higher accuracy and better FPS values, and the proposed dataset extension provides indoor fire classes and a greater number of outdoor fire classes; these contributions can be used in significant future research.

Cryo-electron microscopy recently experienced great improvements in structure resolution due to direct electron detectors with improved contrast and fast read-out leading to single electron counting. High frames rates enabled dose fractionation, where a long exposure is broken into a movie, permitting specimen drift to be registered and corrected. The typical approach for image registration, with high shot noise and low contrast, is multi-reference (MR) cross-correlation. Here we present the software package Zorro, which provides robust drift correction for dose fractionation by use of an intensity-normalized cross-correlation and logistic noise model to weight each cross-correlation in the MR model and filter each cross-correlation optimally. Frames are reliably registered by Zorro with low dose and defocus. Methods to evaluate performance are presented, by use of independently-evaluated even- and odd-frame stacks by trajectory comparison and Fourier ring correlation. Alignment of tiled sub-frames is also introduced, and demonstrated on an example dataset.

Recently, there have been many advances in autonomous driving society, attracting a lot of attention from academia and industry. However, existing studies mainly focus on cars, extra development is still required for self-driving truck algorithms and models. In this article, we introduce an intelligent self-driving truck system. Our presented system consists of three main components, 1) a realistic traffic simulation module for generating realistic traffic flow in testing scenarios, 2) a high-fidelity truck model which is designed and evaluated for mimicking real truck response in real world deployment, and 3) an intelligent planning module with learning-based decision making algorithm and multi-mode trajectory planner, taking into account the truck's constraints, road slope changes, and the surrounding traffic flow. We provide quantitative evaluations for each component individually to demonstrate the fidelity and performance of each part. We also deploy our proposed system on a real truck and conduct real world experiments which show our system's capacity of mitigating sim-to-real gap.

We study the problem of photo cropping, which aims to find a cropping window of an input image to preserve as much as possible its important parts while being aesthetically pleasant. Seeking a deep learning-based solution, we design a neural network that has two branches for attention box prediction (ABP) and aesthetics assessment (AA), respectively. Given the input image, the ABP network predicts an attention bounding box as an initial minimum cropping window, around which a set of cropping candidates are generated with little loss of important information. Then, the AA network is employed to select the final cropping window with the best aesthetic quality among the candidates. The two sub-networks are designed to share the same full-image convolutional feature map, and thus are computationally efficient. By leveraging attention prediction and aesthetics assessment, the cropping model produces high-quality cropping results, even with the limited availability of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results on benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, our approach runs at 5 fps, outperforming most previous solutions.

IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	Technology Integration Methods for Bi-directional Brain-computer Interfaces and XR-based Interventions.	Brain stimulation therapies have been established as effective treatments for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and epilepsy, as well as having high diagnostic and therapeutic potential in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Novel interventions such as extended reality (XR), video games and exergames that can improve physiological and cognitive functioning are also emerging as targets for therapeutic and rehabilitative treatments. Previous studies have proposed specific applications involving non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and virtual environments, but to date these have been uni-directional and restricted to specific applications or proprietary hardware. Here, we describe technology integration methods that enable invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation devices to interface with a cross-platform game engine and development platform for creating bi-directional brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and XR-based interventions. Furthermore, we present a highly-modifiable software framework and methods for integrating deep brain stimulation (DBS) in 2D, 3D, virtual and mixed reality applications, as well as extensible applications for BCI integration in wireless systems.

"The linear mixed model (LMM) is now routinely used to estimate heritability. Unfortunately, as we demonstrate, LMM estimates of heritability can be inflated when using a standard model. To help reduce this inflation, we used a more general LMM with two random effects-one based on genomic variants and one based on easily measured spatial location as a proxy for environmental effects. We investigated this approach with simulated data and with data from a Uganda cohort of 4,778 individuals for 34 phenotypes including anthropometric indices, blood factors, glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid tests, and liver function tests. For the genomic random effect, we used identity-by-descent estimates from accurately phased genome-wide data. For the environmental random effect, we constructed a covariance matrix based on a Gaussian radial basis function. Across the simulated and Ugandan data, narrow-sense heritability estimates were lower using the more general model. Thus, our approach addresses, in part, the issue of ""missing heritability"" in the sense that much of the heritability previously thought to be missing was fictional.

Most multilayer Moore-Penrose inverse (MPI)-based neural networks, such as deep random vector functional link (RVFL), are structured with two separate stages: unsupervised feature encoding and supervised pattern classification. Once the unsupervised learning is finished, the latent encoding is fixed without supervised fine-tuning. However, in complex tasks such as handling the ImageNet dataset, there are often many more clues that can be directly encoded, while unsupervised learning, by definition, cannot know exactly what is useful for a certain task. There is a need to retrain the latent space representations in the supervised pattern classification stage to learn some clues that unsupervised learning has not yet been learned. In particular, the residual error in the output layer is pulled back to each hidden layer, and the parameters of the hidden layers are recalculated with MPI for more robust representations. In this article, a recomputation-based multilayer network using Moore-Penrose inverse (RML-MP) is developed. A sparse RML-MP (SRML-MP) model to boost the performance of RML-MP is then proposed. The experimental results with varying training samples (from 3k to 1.8 million) show that the proposed models provide higher Top-1 testing accuracy than most representation learning algorithms.

Lung adenocarcinoma is a malignancy with a low overall survival and a poor prognosis. Studies have shown that lung adenocarcinoma progression relates to locus-specific/global changes in histone modifications. To explore the relationship between histone modification and gene expression changes, we focused on 11 histone modifications and quantitatively analyzed their influences on gene expression. We found that, among the studied histone modifications, H3K79me2 displayed the greatest impact on gene expression regulation. Based on the Shannon entropy, 867 genes with differential H3K79me2 levels during tumorigenesis were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that these genes were involved in 16 common cancer pathways and 11 tumors and were target-regulated by -regulatory elements, such as Tp53 and WT1. Then, an open-source computational framework was presented (https://github.com/zlq-imu/Identification-of-potential-LUND-driver-genes). Twelve potential driver genes were extracted from the genes with differential H3K79me2 levels during tumorigenesis. The expression levels of these potential driver genes were significantly increased/decreased in tumor cells, as assayed by RT-qPCR. A risk score model comprising these driver genes was further constructed, and this model was strongly negatively associated with the overall survival of patients in different datasets. The proportional hazards assumption and outlier test indicated that this model could robustly distinguish patients with different survival rates. Immune analyses and responses to immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents showed that patients in the high and low-risk groups may have distinct tendencies for clinical selection. Finally, the regions with clear H3K79me2 signal changes on these driver genes were accurately identified. Our research may offer potential molecular biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma treatment. 	github.com/zlq-imu/Identification-of-potential-LUND-driver-genes	https://github.com/zlq-imu/Identification-of-potential-LUND-driver-genes/	zlq-imu	Identification-of-potential-LUND-driver-genes			0.0	0.0		2022-10-18	2022-10-07	repo deleted

Partial face recognition (PFR) in an unconstrained environment is a very important task, especially in situations where partial face images are likely to be captured due to occlusions, out-of-view, and large viewing angle, e.g., video surveillance and mobile devices. However, little attention has been paid to PFR so far and thus, the problem of recognizing an arbitrary patch of a face image remains largely unsolved. This study proposes a novel partial face recognition approach, called Dynamic Feature Matching (DFM), which combines Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) to address partial face recognition problem regardless of various face sizes. DFM does not require prior position information of partial faces against a holistic face. By sharing computation, the feature maps are calculated from the entire input image once, which yields a significant speedup. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of DFM in comparison with state-of-the-art PFR methods on several partial face databases, including CAISA-NIR-Distance, CASIA-NIR-Mobile, and LFW databases. The performance of DFM is also impressive in partial person re-identification on Partial RE-ID and iLIDS databases.
