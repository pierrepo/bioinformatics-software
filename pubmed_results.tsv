Multi-omics data integration has emerged as a promising approach to identify 
patient subgroups. However, in terms of grouping genes (or gene products) into 
co-expression modules, data integration methods suffer from two main drawbacks. 
First, most existing methods only consider genes or samples measured in all 
different datasets. Second, known molecular interactions (e.g., transcriptional 
regulatory interactions, protein-protein interactions and biological pathways) 
cannot be utilized to assist in module detection. Herein, we present a novel 
data integration framework, Correlation-based Local Approximation of Membership 
(CLAM), which provides two methodological innovations to address these 
limitations: 1) constructing a trans-omics neighborhood matrix by integrating 
multi-omics datasets and known molecular interactions, and 2) using a local 
approximation procedure to define gene modules from the matrix. Applying 
Correlation-based Local Approximation of Membership to human colorectal cancer 
(CRC) and mouse B-cell differentiation multi-omics data obtained from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA), Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ProteomeXchange database, we demonstrated its 
superior ability to recover biologically relevant modules and gene ontology (GO) 
terms. Further investigation of the colorectal cancer modules revealed numerous 
transcription factors and KEGG pathways that played crucial roles in colorectal 
cancer progression. Module-based survival analysis constructed four 
survival-related networks in which pairwise gene correlations were significantly 
correlated with colorectal cancer patient survival. Overall, the series of 
evaluations demonstrated the great potential of Correlation-based Local 
Approximation of Membership for identifying modular biomarkers for complex 
diseases. We implemented Correlation-based Local Approximation of Membership as 
a user-friendly application available at https://github.com/free1234hm/CLAM.

Cross-modal hashing is an efficient method to embed high-dimensional 
heterogeneous modal feature descriptors into a consistency-preserving Hamming 
space with low-dimensional. Most existing cross-modal hashing methods have been 
able to bridge the heterogeneous modality gap, but there are still two 
challenges resulting in limited retrieval accuracy: (1) ignoring the continuous 
similarity of samples on manifold; (2) lack of discriminability of hash codes 
with the same semantics. To cope with these problems, we propose a Deep 
Consistency-Preserving Hash Auto-encoders model, called DCPHA, based on the 
multi-manifold property of the feature distribution. Specifically, DCPHA 
consists of a pair of asymmetric auto-encoders and two semantics-preserving 
attention branches working in the encoding and decoding stages, respectively. 
When the number of input medical image modalities is greater than 2, the encoder 
is a multiple pseudo-Siamese network designed to extract specific modality 
features of different medical image modalities. In addition, we define the 
continuous similarity of heterogeneous and homogeneous samples on Riemann 
manifold from the perspective of multiple sub-manifolds, respectively, and the 
two constraints, i.e., multi-semantic consistency and multi-manifold 
similarity-preserving, are embedded in the learning of hash codes to obtain 
high-quality hash codes with consistency-preserving. The extensive experiments 
show that the proposed DCPHA has the most stable and state-of-the-art 
performance. We make code and models publicly available:

The chromatin interaction assays, particularly Hi-C, enable detailed studies of 
genome architecture in multiple organisms and model systems, resulting in a 
deeper understanding of gene expression regulation mechanisms mediated by 
epigenetics. However, the analysis and interpretation of Hi-C data remain 
challenging due to technical biases, limiting direct comparisons of datasets 
obtained in different experiments and laboratories. As a result, removing biases 
from Hi-C-generated chromatin contact matrices is a critical data analysis step. 
Our novel approach, HiConfidence, eliminates biases from the Hi-C data by 
weighing chromatin contacts according to their consistency between replicates so 
that low-quality replicates do not substantially influence the result. The 
algorithm is effective for the analysis of global changes in chromatin 
structures such as compartments and topologically associating domains. We apply 
the HiConfidence approach to several Hi-C datasets with significant technical 
biases, that could not be analyzed effectively using existing methods, and 
obtain meaningful biological conclusions. In particular, HiConfidence aids in 
the study of how changes in histone acetylation pattern affect chromatin 
organization in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. The method is freely available

Long-read sequencing technology is a powerful approach with application in 
various genetic and genomic researches. Herein, we developed the pipeline for 
long amplicon high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing and then applied it for sequencing 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes from pools of 79 Tibetan Mastiffs. We 
amplified the mtDNA genome with long-range PCR using two pairs of primers. Two 
rounds of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) were conducted and their accuracy 
was evaluated. The results indicate that the second round of CCS can improve the 
accuracy of HiFi reads. In addition, the analysis of 79 high-quality mtDNA 
genomes shows the Tibetan Mastiffs from outside of the Tibetan Plateau 
experienced hybridization with other dogs. The High Quality Reads Generator 
(HQGR) software is provided to facilitate data analyses, which is publicly 
accessible on GitHub (https://github.com/Caizf-script/HQGR). Our long amplicon 
HiFi sequencing pipeline can also be applied in various target enrichment 
strategies for small genomes and candidate genes.

Multi-task deep autoencoder to predict Alzheimer's disease progression using

Traditional approaches for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as brain 
imaging and cerebrospinal fluid are invasive and expensive. It is desirable to 
develop a useful diagnostic tool by exploiting biomarkers obtained from 
peripheral tissues due to their noninvasive and easily accessible 
characteristics. However, the capacity of using DNA methylation data in 
peripheral blood for predicting AD progression is rarely known. It is also 
challenging to develop an efficient prediction model considering the complex and 
high-dimensional DNA methylation data in a longitudinal study. Here, we develop 
two multi-task deep autoencoders, which are based on the convolutional 
autoencoder and long short-term memory autoencoder to learn the compressed 
feature representation by jointly minimizing the reconstruction error and 
maximizing the prediction accuracy. By benchmarking on longitudinal DNA 
methylation data collected from the peripheral blood in Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, we demonstrate that the proposed multi-task deep 
autoencoders outperform state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for both 
predicting AD progression and reconstructing the temporal DNA methylation 
profiles. In addition, the proposed multi-task deep autoencoders can predict AD 
progression accurately using only the historical DNA methylation data and the 
performance is further improved by including all temporal DNA methylation data.

Decades of overconsumption of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of 
bacterial infections have resulted in the increasing emergence of drug-resistant 
bacteria, which poses a significant challenge to public health, driving the 
urgent need to find alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Bacteriophages are 
viruses infecting specific bacterial hosts, often destroying the infected 
bacterial hosts. Phages attach to and enter their potential hosts using their 
tail proteins, with the composition of the tail determining the range of 
potentially infected bacteria. To aid the exploitation of bacteriophages for 
therapeutic purposes, we developed the PhageTailFinder algorithm to predict 
tail-related proteins and identify the putative tail module in previously 
uncharacterized phages. The PhageTailFinder relies on a two-state hidden Markov 
model (HMM) to predict the probability of a given protein being tail-related. 
The process takes into account the natural modularity of phage tail-related 
proteins, rather than simply considering amino acid properties or secondary 
structures for each protein in isolation. The PhageTailFinder exhibited robust 
predictive power for phage tail proteins in novel phages due to this 
sequence-independent operation. The performance of the prediction model was 
evaluated in 13 extensively studied phages and a sample of 992 complete phages 
from the NCBI database. The algorithm achieved a high true-positive prediction 
rate (>80%) in over half (571) of the studied phages, and the ROC value was 
0.877 using general models and 0.968 using corresponding morphologic models. It 
is notable that the median ROC value of 992 complete phages is more than 0.75 
even for novel phages, indicating the high accuracy and specificity of the 
PhageTailFinder. When applied to a dataset containing 189,680 viral genomes 
derived from 11,810 bulk metagenomic human stool samples, the ROC value was 
0.895. In addition, tail protein clusters could be identified for further 
studies by density-based spatial clustering of applications with the noise 
algorithm (DBSCAN). The developed PhageTailFinder tool can be accessed either as 
a web server 
(http://www.microbiome-bigdata.com/PHISDetector/index/tools/PhageTailFinder) or 
as a stand-alone program on a standard desktop computer

BACKGROUND: Protein S-nitrosylation (SNO) plays a key role in transferring 
nitric oxide-mediated signals in both animals and plants and has emerged as an 
important mechanism for regulating protein functions and cell signaling of all 
main classes of protein. It is involved in several biological processes 
including immune response, protein stability, transcription regulation, post 
translational regulation, DNA damage repair, redox regulation, and is an 
emerging paradigm of redox signaling for protection against oxidative stress. 
The development of robust computational tools to predict protein SNO sites would 
contribute to further interpretation of the pathological and physiological 
mechanisms of SNO.
RESULTS: Using an intermediate fusion-based stacked generalization approach, we 
integrated embeddings from supervised embedding layer and contextualized protein 
language model (ProtT5) and developed a tool called pLMSNOSite (protein language 
model-based SNO site predictor). On an independent test set of experimentally 
identified SNO sites, pLMSNOSite achieved values of 0.340, 0.735 and 0.773 for 
MCC, sensitivity and specificity respectively. These results show that 
pLMSNOSite performs better than the compared approaches for the prediction of 
S-nitrosylation sites.
CONCLUSION: Together, the experimental results suggest that pLMSNOSite achieves 
significant improvement in the prediction performance of S-nitrosylation sites 
and represents a robust computational approach for predicting protein 
S-nitrosylation sites. pLMSNOSite could be a useful resource for further 
elucidation of SNO and is publicly available at 
https://github.com/KCLabMTU/pLMSNOSite .

Feature gene selection has significant impact on the performance of cell 
clustering in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. A well-rounded 
feature selection (FS) method should consider relevance, redundancy and 
complementarity of the features. Yet most existing FS methods focus on gene 
relevance to the cell types but neglect redundancy and complementarity, which 
undermines the cell clustering performance. We develop a novel computational 
method GeneClust to select feature genes for scRNA-seq cell clustering. 
GeneClust groups genes based on their expression profiles, then selects genes 
with the aim of maximizing relevance, minimizing redundancy and preserving 
complementarity. It can work as a plug-in tool for FS with any existing cell 
clustering method. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate that GeneClust 
significantly improve the clustering performance. Moreover, GeneClust can group 
cofunctional genes in biological process and pathway into clusters, thus 
providing a means of investigating gene interactions and identifying potential 
genes relevant to biological characteristics of the dataset. GeneClust is freely 
available at https://github.com/ToryDeng/scGeneClust.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural network models have been widely 
adapted in medical imaging and applied to address different clinical problems. 
However, the complexity and scale of such models may not be justified in medical 
imaging and subject to the available resource budget. Further increasing the 
number of representative feature maps for the classification task decreases the 
model explainability. The current data normalization practice is fixed prior to 
model development and discounting the specification of the data domain. 
Acknowledging these issues, the current work proposed a new scalable model 
family called PlexusNet; the block architecture and model scaling by the 
network's depth, width, and branch regulate PlexusNet's architecture. The 
efficient computation costs outlined the dimensions of PlexusNet scaling and 
design. PlexusNet includes a new learnable data normalization algorithm for 
better data generalization. We applied a simple yet effective neural 
architecture search to design PlexusNet tailored to five clinical classification 
problems that achieve a performance noninferior to the SOTA models ResNet-18 and 
EfficientNet B0/1. It also does so with lower parameter capacity and 
representative feature maps in ten-fold ranges than the smallest SOTA models 
with comparable performance. The visualization of representative features 
revealed distinguishable clusters associated with categories based on latent 
features generated by PlexusNet. The package and source code are at

MOTIVATION: With the rapidly growing volume of knowledge and data in biomedical 
databases, improved methods for knowledge-graph-based computational reasoning 
are needed in order to answer translational questions. Previous efforts to solve 
such challenging computational reasoning problems have contributed tools and 
approaches, but progress has been hindered by the lack of an expressive analysis 
workflow language for translational reasoning and by the lack of a reasoning 
engine-supporting that language-that federates semantically integrated 
knowledge-bases.
RESULTS: We introduce ARAX, a new reasoning system for translational biomedicine 
that provides a web browser user interface and an application programming 
interface. ARAX enables users to encode translational biomedical questions and 
to integrate knowledge across sources to answer the user's query and facilitate 
exploration of results. For ARAX, we developed new approaches to query planning, 
knowledge-gathering, reasoning, and result ranking and dynamically integrate 
knowledge providers for answering biomedical questions. To illustrate ARAX's 
application and utility in specific disease contexts, we present several 
use-case examples.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and technical documentation for 
building the ARAX server-side software and its built-in knowledge database are 
freely available online (https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX). We provide a hosted 
ARAX service with a web browser interface at arax.rtx.ai and a web application 
programming interface (API) endpoint at arax.rtx.ai/api/arax/v1.3/ui/.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.

BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important driver in genome 
evolution, gain-of-function, and metabolic adaptation to environmental niches. 
Genome-wide identification of putative HGT events has become increasingly 
practical, given the rapid growth of genomic data. However, existing HGT 
analysis toolboxes are not widely used, limited by their inability to perform 
phylogenetic reconstruction to explore potential donors, and the detection of 
HGT from both evolutionarily distant and closely related species.
RESULTS: In this study, we have developed HGTphyloDetect, which is a versatile 
computational toolbox that combines high-throughput analysis with phylogenetic 
inference, to facilitate comprehensive investigation of HGT events. Two case 
studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida versatilis demonstrate the 
ability of HGTphyloDetect to identify horizontally acquired genes with high 
accuracy. In addition, HGTphyloDetect enables phylogenetic analysis to 
illustrate a likely path of gene transmission among the evolutionarily distant 
or closely related species.
CONCLUSIONS: The HGTphyloDetect computational toolbox is designed for ease of 
use and can accurately find HGT events with a very low false discovery rate in a 
high-throughput manner. The HGTphyloDetect toolbox and its related user tutorial 
are freely available at https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/HGTphyloDetect.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most challenging neurodegenerative 
diseases because of its complicated and progressive mechanisms, and multiple 
risk factors. Increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a 
key factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. Although previous 
reports identified quite a few AD-associated genes, they were mostly limited 
owing to patient sample size and selection bias. There is a lack of 
comprehensive research aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations 
systematically. To address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD 
mutation and co-mutation framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning 
models named Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that 
are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on 
genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized 
frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and 
identified mutation effectors and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities 
contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of 
mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization 
of AD and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, 
laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision 
medicine. Our deep learning model codes are available open access here:

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism is a kind of cardiovascular disease that 
threatens human life and health. Since pulmonary embolism exists in pulmonary 
artery, improving the segmentation accuracy of pulmonary artery is the key to 
the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Traditional medical image segmentation 
methods have limited effectiveness in pulmonary artery segmentation. In recent 
years, deep learning methods have been gradually adopted to solve complex 
problems in the field of medical image segmentation.
PURPOSE: Due to the irregular shape of the pulmonary artery and the 
adjacent-complex tissues, the accuracy of the existing pulmonary artery 
segmentation methods based on deep learning need to be improved. Therefore, the 
purpose of this paper is to develop a segmentation network, which can obtain 
higher segmentation accuracy and further improve the diagnosis effect.
METHODS: In this study, the pulmonary artery segmentation performance from the 
network model and loss function is improved, proposing a pulmonary artery 
segmentation network (PA-Net) to segment the pulmonary artery region from 2D CT 
images. Reverse Attention and edge attention are used to enhance the expression 
ability of the boundary. In addition, to better use feature information, the 
channel attention module is introduced in the decoder to highlight the important 
channel features and suppress the unimportant channels. Due to blurred 
boundaries, pixels near the boundaries of the pulmonary artery may be difficult 
to segment. Therefore, a new contour loss function based on the active contour 
model is proposed in this study to segment the target region by assigning 
dynamic weights to false positive and false negative regions and accurately 
predict the boundary structure.
RESULTS: The experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy of this 
proposed method is significantly improved in comparison with state-of-the-art 
segmentation methods, and the Dice coefficient is 0.938±0.035, which is also 
confirmed from the 3D reconstruction results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method can accurately segment pulmonary artery 
structure. This new development will provide the possibility for further rapid 
diagnosis of pulmonary artery diseases such as pulmonary embolism. Code is

The development and progression of cancer arise due to the accumulation of 
mutations in driver genes. Correctly identifying the driver genes that lead to 
cancer development can significantly assist the drug design, cancer diagnosis 
and treatment. Most computer methods detect cancer drivers based on gene-gene 
networks by assuming that driver genes tend to work together, form protein 
complexes and enrich pathways. However, they ignore that microribonucleic acid 
(RNAs; miRNAs) regulate the expressions of their targeted genes and are related 
to human diseases. In this work, we propose a graph convolution network (GCN) 
approach called GM-GCN to identify the cancer driver genes based on a gene-miRNA 
network. First, we constructed a gene-miRNA network, where the nodes are miRNAs 
and their targeted genes. The edges connecting miRNA and genes indicate the 
regulatory relationship between miRNAs and genes. We prepared initial attributes 
for miRNA and genes according to their biological properties and used a GCN 
model to learn the gene feature representations in the network by aggregating 
the features of their neighboring miRNA nodes. And then, the learned features 
were passed through a 1D convolution module for feature dimensionality change. 
We employed the learned and original gene features to optimize model parameters. 
Finally, the gene features learned from the network and the initial input gene 
features were fed into a logistic regression model to predict whether a gene is 
a driver gene. We applied our model and state-of-the-art methods to predict 
cancer drivers for pan-cancer and individual cancer types. Experimental results 
show that our model performs well in terms of the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall curve 
compared to state-of-the-art methods that work on gene networks. The GM-GCN is

We consider a generic representation problem of internal coordinates (bond 
lengths, valence angles, and dihedral angles) and their transformation to 
3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of a biomolecule. We show that the 
internal-to-Cartesian process relies on correctly predicting chemically subtle 
correlations among the internal coordinates themselves, and learning these 
correlations increases the fidelity of the Cartesian representation. We 
developed a machine learning algorithm, Int2Cart, to predict bond lengths and 
bond angles from backbone torsion angles and residue types of a protein, which 
allows reconstruction of protein structures better than using fixed bond lengths 
and bond angles or a static library method that relies on backbone torsion 
angles and residue types in a local environment. The method is able to be used 
for structure validation, as we show that the agreement between 
Int2Cart-predicted bond geometries and those from an AlphaFold 2 model can be 
used to estimate model quality. Additionally, by using Int2Cart to reconstruct 
an IDP ensemble, we are able to decrease the clash rate during modeling. The 
Int2Cart algorithm has been implemented as a publicly accessible python package 
at https://github.com/THGLab/int2cart.

Extracting entities and relations from the unstructured text has attracted 
increasing attention in recent years. The existing work has achieved 
considerable results, yet it is difficult to solve entity overlap and exposure 
bias. To address cascading errors, exposure bias, and entity overlap in existing 
entity relation extraction approaches, we propose a joint entity relation 
extraction model (SMHS) based on a span-level multi-head selection mechanism, 
transforming entity relation extraction into a span-level multi-head selection 
problem. Our model uses span-tagger and span-embedding to construct span 
semantic vectors, utilizes LSTM and multi-head self-attention mechanism for span 
feature extraction, multi-head selection mechanism for span-level relation 
decoding, and introduces span classification task for multi-task learning to 
decode out the relation triad in a single-stage. Experiments on the classic 
English dataset NYT and the publicly available Chinese relationship extraction 
dataset DuIE 2.0 show that this method achieves better results than the baseline 
method, which verifies the effectiveness of this method. Source code and data 
are published here(https://github.com/Beno-waxgourd/NLP.git).

We present an improved algorithm to solve the near-congruence problem for rigid 
molecules and clusters based on the iterative application of assignment and 
alignment steps with biased Euclidean costs. The algorithm is formulated as a 
quasi-local optimization procedure with each optimization step involving a 
linear assignment (LAP) and a singular value decomposition (SVD). The efficiency 
of the algorithm is increased by up to 5 orders of magnitude with respect to the 
original unbiased noniterative method and can be applied to systems with 
hundreds or thousands of atoms, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods 
published so far in the literature. The Fortran implementation of the algorithm 
is available as an open source library (https://github.com/qcuaeh/molalignlib) 
and is suitable to be used in global optimization methods for the identification 
of local minima or basins.

Neuropeptides play pivotal roles in different physiological processes and are 
related to different kinds of diseases. Identification of neuropeptides is of 
great benefit for studying the mechanism of these physiological processes and 
the treatment of neurological disorders. Several state-of-the-art neuropeptide 
predictors have been developed by using a two-layer stacking ensemble algorithm. 
Although the two-layer stacking ensemble algorithm can improve the feature 
representability, these models are complex, which are not as efficient as the 
models based on one classifier. In this study, we proposed a new model, 
NeuroPpred-SVM, to predict neuropeptides based on the embeddings of 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and other sequential 
features by using a support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results 
indicate that our model achieved a cross-validation area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.969 on the training data set and an 
AUROC of 0.966 on the independent test set. By comparing our model with the 
other four state-of-the-art models including NeuroPIpred, PredNeuroP, 
NeuroPpred-Fuse, and NeuroPpred-FRL on the independent test set, our model 
achieved the highest AUROC, Matthews correlation coefficient, accuracy, and 
specificity, which indicate that our model outperforms the existing models. We 
believed that NeuroPpred-SVM could be a useful tool for identifying 
neuropeptides with high accuracy and low cost. The data sets and Python code are 
available at https://github.com/liuyf-a/NeuroPpred-SVM.

MOTIVATION: Pairwise sequence alignment remains a fundamental problem in 
computational biology and bioinformatics. Recent advances in genomics and 
sequencing technologies demand faster and scalable algorithms that can cope with 
the ever-increasing sequence lengths. Classical pairwise alignment algorithms 
based on dynamic programming are strongly limited by quadratic requirements in 
time and memory. The recently proposed wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA) 
introduced an efficient algorithm to perform exact gap-affine alignment in O(ns) 
time, where s is the optimal score and n is the sequence length. Notwithstanding 
these bounds, WFA's O(s2) memory requirements become computationally impractical 
for genome-scale alignments, leading to a need for further improvement.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present the bidirectional WFA algorithm (BiWFA), the 
first gap-affine algorithm capable of computing optimal alignments in O(s) 
memory while retaining WFA's time complexity of O(ns). As a result, this work 
improves the lowest known memory bound O(n) to compute gap-affine alignments. In 
practice, our implementation never requires more than a few hundred MBs aligning 
noisy Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads up to 1 Mbp long while maintaining 
competitive execution times.

Interactions between DNA and transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role 
in understanding transcriptional regulation mechanisms and gene expression. Due 
to the large accumulation of training data and low expense, deep learning 
methods have shown huge potential in determining the specificity of TFs-DNA 
interactions. Convolutional network-based and self-attention network-based 
methods have been proposed for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) 
prediction. Convolutional operations are efficient to extract local features but 
easy to ignore global information, while self-attention mechanisms are expert in 
capturing long-distance dependencies but difficult to pay attention to local 
feature details. To discover comprehensive features for a given sequence as far 
as possible, we propose a Dual-branch model combining Self-Attention and 
Convolution, dubbed as DSAC, which fuses local features and global 
representations in an interactive way. In terms of features, convolution and 
self-attention contribute to feature extraction collaboratively, enhancing the 
representation learning. In terms of structure, a lightweight but efficient 
architecture of network is designed for the prediction, in particular, the 
dual-branch structure makes the convolution and the self-attention mechanism can 
be fully utilized to improve the predictive ability of our model. The experiment 
results on 165 ChIP-seq datasets show that DSAC obviously outperforms other five 
deep learning based methods and demonstrate that our model can effectively 
predict TFBSs based on sequence feature alone. The source code of DSAC is 
available at https://github.com/YuBinLab-QUST/DSAC/.

Metastatic progression and tumor evolution complicates the clinical management 
of cancer patients. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) characterization is a growing 
discipline that aims to elucidate tumor metastasis and evolution processes. CTCs 
offer the clinical potential to monitor cancer patients for therapy response, 
disease relapse, and screen 'at risk' groups for the onset of malignancy. 
However, such clinical utility is currently limited to breast, prostate, and 
colorectal cancer patients. Further understanding of the basic CTC biology of 
other malignancies is required to progress them towards clinical utility. 
Unfortunately, such basic clinical research is often limited by restrictive 
characterization methods and high-cost barrier to entry for CTC isolation and 
imaging infrastructure. As experimental clinical results on applications of CTC 
are accumulating, it is becoming clear that a two-tier system of CTC isolation 
and characterization is required. The first tier is to facilitate basic research 
into CTC characterization. This basic research then informs a second tier 
specialised in clinical prognostic and diagnostic testing. This study presented 
in this manuscript describes the development and application of a low-cost, CTC 
isolation and characterization pipeline; CTC-5. This approach uses an 
established 'isolation by size' approach (ScreenCell Cyto) and combines 
histochemical morphology stains and multiparametric immunofluorescence on the 
same isolated CTCs. This enables capture and characterization of CTCs 
independent of biomarker-based pre-selection and accommodates both single CTCs 
and clusters of CTCs. Additionally, the developed open-source software is 
provided to facilitate the synchronization of microscopy data from multiple 
sources (https://github.com/CTC5/). This enables high parameter histochemical 
and immunofluorescent analysis of CTCs with existing microscopy infrastructure 
without investment in CTC specific imaging hardware. Our approach confirmed by 
the number of successful tests represents a potential major advance towards 
highly accessible low-cost technology aiming at the basic research tier of CTC 
isolation and characterization. The biomarker independent approach facilitates 
closing the gap between malignancies with poorly, and well-defined CTC 
phenotypes. As is currently the case for some of the most commonly occurring 
breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, such advances will ultimately benefit 
the patient, as early detection of relapse or onset of malignancy strongly 
correlates with their prognosis.

scMINER: a mutual information-based framework for identifying hidden drivers 
from single-cell omics data.

Yu J, Ding L, Shi H, Qian C, Burdyshaw C, Veloso J, Khatamian A, Pan Q, Dhungana 
Y, Xie Z, Risch I, Yang X, Huang X, Yan L, Rusch M, Brewer M, Yan KK, Chi H.

The sparse nature of single-cell omics data makes it challenging to dissect the 
wiring and rewiring of the transcriptional and signaling drivers that regulate 
cellular states. Many of the drivers, referred to as ""hidden drivers"", are 
difficult to identify via conventional expression analysis due to low expression 
and inconsistency between RNA and protein activity caused by post-translational 
and other modifications. To address this issue, we developed scMINER, a mutual 
information (MI)-based computational framework for unsupervised clustering 
analysis and cell-type specific inference of intracellular networks, hidden 
drivers and network rewiring from single-cell RNA-seq data. We designed scMINER 
to capture nonlinear cell-cell and gene-gene relationships and infer driver 
activities. Systematic benchmarking showed that scMINER outperforms popular 
single-cell clustering algorithms, especially in distinguishing similar cell 
types. With respect to network inference, scMINER does not rely on the binding 
motifs which are available for a limited set of transcription factors, therefore 
scMINER can provide quantitative activity assessment for more than 6,000 
transcription and signaling drivers from a scRNA-seq experiment. As 
demonstrations, we used scMINER to expose hidden transcription and signaling 
drivers and dissect their regulon rewiring in immune cell heterogeneity, lineage 
differentiation, and tissue specification. Overall, activity-based scMINER is a 
widely applicable, highly accurate, reproducible and scalable method for 
inferring cellular transcriptional and signaling networks in each cell state 
from scRNA-seq data. The scMINER software is publicly accessible via:

An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence to 
function learning.

Balcı AT, Ebeid MM, Benos PV, Kostka D, Chikina M.

MOTIVATION: Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a 
multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin 
and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is 
that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post-hoc analyses, 
and even then, we often cannot explain the internal mechanics of highly 
parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called 
tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon 
the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer 
parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural 
network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of 
relevant sequence motifs.
RESULTS: tiSFM's model architecture makes use of convolutions with a fixed set 
of kernel weights representing known transcription factor (TF) binding site 
motifs. We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic 
lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state- of-the-art 
convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show 
that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription 
factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and 
Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM's model parameters 
have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our 
approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a 
function of developmental transition.

analysis of key findings, can be found at https://github.com/boooooogey/ATAConv

Joint tensor modeling of single cell 3D genome and epigenetic data with Muscle.

Park K, Keleş S.

Emerging single cell technologies that simultaneously capture long-range 
interactions of genomic loci together with their DNA methylation levels are 
advancing our understanding of three-dimensional genome structure and its 
interplay with the epigenome at the single cell level. While methods to analyze 
data from single cell high throughput chromatin conformation capture (scHi-C) 
experiments are maturing, methods that can jointly analyze multiple single cell 
modalities with scHi-C data are lacking. Here, we introduce Muscle, a 
semi-nonnegative joint decomposition of Mu ltiple s ingle c el l t e nsors, to 
jointly analyze 3D conformation and DNA methylation data at the single cell 
level. Muscle takes advantage of the inherent tensor structure of the scHi-C 
data, and integrates this modality with DNA methylation. We developed an 
alternating least squares algorithm for estimating Muscle parameters and 
established its optimality properties. Parameters estimated by Muscle directly 
align with the key components of the downstream analysis of scHi-C data in a 
cell type specific manner. Evaluations with data-driven experiments and 
simulations demonstrate the advantages of the joint modeling framework of Muscle 
over single modality modeling or a baseline multi modality modeling for cell 
type delineation and elucidating associations between modalities. Muscle is 
publicly available at https://github.com/keleslab/muscle .

HAT: de novo variant calling for highly accurate short-read and long-read 
sequencing data.

Ng JK, Turner TN.

MOTIVATION: de novo variant (DNV) calling is challenging from parent-child 
sequenced trio data. We developed H are A nd T ortoise (HAT) to work as an 
automated workflow to detect DNVs in highly accurate short-read and long-read 
sequencing data. Reliable detection of DNVs is important for human genetics 
studies (e.g., autism, epilepsy).
RESULTS: HAT is a workflow to detect DNVs from short-read and long read 
sequencing data. This workflow begins with aligned read data (i.e., CRAM or BAM) 
from a parent-child sequenced trio and outputs DNVs. HAT detects high-quality 
DNVs from short-read whole-exome sequencing, short-read wholegenome sequencing, 
and highly accurate long-read sequencing data.

scGREAT: Graph-based regulatory element analysis tool for single-cell 
multi-omics data.

Liu C, Wang L, Liu Z.

MOTIVATION: With the development in single-cell multi-omics sequencing 
technology and data integration algorithms, we have entered the single-cell 
multi-omics era. Current multi-omics analysis algorithms failed to 
systematically dissect the heterogeneity within the datasets when inferring 
cis-regulatory events. Thus, there is a need for cis-regulatory element 
inferring algorithms that considers the cellular heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Here, we propose scGREAT, a single-cell multi-omics regulatory state 
analysis Python package with a rapid graph-based correlation measurement L . The 
graph-based correlation method assigns each cell a local L index, pinpointing 
specific cell groups of certain regulatory states. Such single-cell resolved 
regulatory state information enables the heterogeneity analysis equipped in the 
package. Applying scGREAT to the 10X Multiome PBMC dataset, we demonstrated how 
it could help subcluster cell types, infer regulation-based pseudo-time 
trajectory, discover feature modules, and find cluster-specific regulatory 
gene-peak pairs. Besides, we showed that global L index, which is the average of 
all local L values, is a better replacement for Pearsonâ€™s r in ruling out 
confounding regulatory relationships that are not of research interests.

The amount of data produced by genome sequencing experiments has been growing 
rapidly over the past several years, making compression important for efficient 
storage, transfer and analysis of the data. In recent years, nanopore sequencing 
technologies have seen increasing adoption since they are portable, real-time 
and provide long reads. However, there has been limited progress on compression 
of nanopore sequencing reads obtained in FASTQ files since most existing tools 
are either general-purpose or specialized for short read data. We present 
NanoSpring, a reference-free compressor for nanopore sequencing reads, relying 
on an approximate assembly approach. We evaluate NanoSpring on a variety of 
datasets including bacterial, metagenomic, plant, animal, and human whole genome 
data. For recently basecalled high quality nanopore datasets, NanoSpring, which 
focuses only on the base sequences in the FASTQ file, uses just 0.35-0.65 bits 
per base which is 3-6[Formula: see text] lower than general purpose compressors 
like gzip. NanoSpring is competitive in compression ratio and compression 
resource usage with the state-of-the-art tool CoLoRd while being significantly 
faster at decompression when using multiple threads (> 4[Formula: see text] 
faster decompression with 20 threads). NanoSpring is available on GitHub at 
https://github.com/qm2/NanoSpring .

The 3D point clouds are increasingly being used in various application including 
safety-critical fields. It has recently been demonstrated that deep neural 
networks can successfully process 3D point clouds. However, these deep networks 
can be misclassified via 3D adversarial attacks intentionality designed to 
perturb some point cloud's features. These misclassifications may be due to the 
network's overreliance on features with unnecessary information in training 
sets. As such, identifying the features used by deep classifiers and removing 
features with unnecessary information from the training data can improve 
network's robustness against adversarial attacks. In this paper, the LPF-Defense 
framework is proposed to discard this unnecessary information from the training 
data by suppressing the high-frequency content in the training phase. Our 
analysis shows that adversarial perturbations are found in the high-frequency 
contents of adversarial point clouds. Experiments showed that the proposed 
defense method achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance against six 
adversarial attacks on PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN models. The findings are 
practically supported by an expansive evaluation of synthetic (ModelNet40 and 
ShapeNet) and real datasets (ScanObjectNN). In particular, improvements are 
achieved with an average increase of classification accuracy by 3.8% on Drop100 
attack and 4.26% on Drop200 attack compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The 
method also improves models' accuracy on the original dataset compared to other 
available methods. (To facilitate research in this area, an open-source 
implementation of the method and data is released at

Automated liver segmentation from radiology scans (CT, MRI) can improve surgery 
and therapy planning and follow-up assessment in addition to conventional use 
for diagnosis and prognosis. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have 
became the standard image segmentation tasks, more recently this has started to 
change towards Transformers based architectures because Transformers are taking 
advantage of capturing long range dependence modeling capability in signals, so 
called attention mechanism. In this study, we propose a new segmentation 
approach using a hybrid approach combining the Transformer(s) with the 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach. The premise behind this choice is 
that the self-attention mechanism of the Transformers allows the network to 
aggregate the high dimensional feature and provide global information modeling. 
This mechanism provides better segmentation performance compared with 
traditional methods. Furthermore, we encode this generator into the GAN based 
architecture so that the discriminator network in the GAN can classify the 
credibility of the generated segmentation masks compared with the real masks 
coming from human (expert) annotations. This allows us to extract the high 
dimensional topology information in the mask for biomedical image segmentation 
and provide more reliable segmentation results. Our model achieved a high dice 
coefficient of 0.9433, recall of 0.9515, and precision of 0.9376 and 
outperformed other Transformer based approaches. The implementation details of 
the proposed architecture can be found at

MOTIVATION: Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples 
such as tissues. It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue 
in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the 
tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images 
facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of 
ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for 
clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are 
therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative 
methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on 
natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are 
substantially noisier than natural images.
RESULTS: We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts 
for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated 
dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the 
proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more 
frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image 
clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a 
subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one 
ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the 
interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

MOTIVATION: The findings from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have 
greatly helped us to understand the genetic basis of human complex traits and 
diseases. Despite the tremendous progress, much effects are still needed to 
address several major challenges arising in GWAS. First, most GWAS hits are 
located in the non-coding region of human genome, and thus their biological 
functions largely remain unknown. Second, due to the polygenicity of human 
complex traits and diseases, many genetic risk variants with weak or moderate 
effects have not been identified yet.
RESULTS: To address the above challenges, we propose a powerful and adaptive 
latent model (PALM) to integrate cell-type/tissue specific functional 
annotations with GWAS summary statistics. Unlike existing methods which are 
mainly based on linear models, PALM leverages a tree ensemble to adaptively 
characterize nonlinear relationship between functional annotations and the 
association status of genetic variants. To make PALM scalable to millions of 
variants and hundreds of functional annotations, we develop a functional 
gradient-based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, to fit the tree-based 
nonlinear model in a stable manner. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we 
show that PALM not only controls false discovery rate well, but also improves 
statistical power of identifying risk variants. We also apply PALM to integrate 
summary statistics of 30 GWASs with 127 cell type/tissue-specific functional 
annotations. The results indicate that PALM can identify more risk variants as 
well as rank the importance of functional annotations, yielding better 
interpretation of GWAS results.

SUMMARY: As the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles 
have become widely accepted in the proteomics field, under the guidance of 
ProteomeXchange (PX) and The Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards 
Initiative (HUPO-PSI), proteomics public databases have been providing 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for programmatic access. Based on 
generating logic from proteomics data, we present Patpat, an extensible 
framework for searching public datasets, merging results from multiple databases 
to help researchers find their proteins of interest in the vast mass 
spectrometry. Patpat's two-dimensional strategy of combining results from 
multiple databases allows users to provide only protein identifiers to obtain 
metadata for relevant datasets, improving the ""Findable"" of proteomics data.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Patpat framework is released under the 
Apache 2.0 license open source, and the source code is stored on GitHub 
(https://github.com/henry-leo/Patpat) and is freely available.

NanoSTR: A method for detection of target short tandem repeats based on nanopore 
sequencing data.

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are widely present in the human genome. Studies have 
confirmed that STRs are associated with more than 30 diseases, and they have 
also been used in forensic identification and paternity testing. However, there 
are few methods for STR detection based on nanopore sequencing due to the 
challenges posed by the sequencing principles and the data characteristics of 
nanopore sequencing. We developed NanoSTR for detection of target STR loci based 
on the length-number-rank (LNR) information of reads. NanoSTR can be used for 
STR detection and genotyping based on long-read data from nanopore sequencing 
with improved accuracy and efficiency compared with other existing methods, such 
as Tandem-Genotypes and TRiCoLOR. NanoSTR showed 100% concordance with the 
expected genotypes using error-free simulated data, and also achieved >85% 
concordance using the standard samples (containing autosomal and Y-chromosomal 
loci) with MinION sequencing platform, respectively. NanoSTR showed high 
performance for detection of target STR markers. Although NanoSTR needs further 
optimization and development, it is useful as an analytical method for the 
detection of STR loci by nanopore sequencing. This method adds to the toolbox 
for nanopore-based STR analysis and expands the applications of nanopore 
sequencing in scientific research and clinical scenarios. The main code and the 
data are available at https://github.com/langjidong/NanoSTR.

The immune memory repertoire encodes the history of present and past infections 
and immunological attributes of the individual. As such, multiple methods were 
proposed to use T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires to detect disease history. We 
here show that the counting method outperforms two leading algorithms. We then 
show that the counting can be further improved using a novel attention model to 
weigh the different TCRs. The attention model is based on the projection of TCRs 
using a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Both counting and attention algorithms 
predict better than current leading algorithms whether the host had CMV and its 
HLA alleles. As an intermediate solution between the complex attention model and 
the very simple counting model, we propose a new Graph Convolutional Network 
approach that obtains the accuracy of the attention model and the simplicity of 
the counting model. The code for the models used in the paper is provided at:

Background: Pseudouridine (Ψ) is one of the most abundant RNA modifications 
found in a variety of RNA types, and it plays a significant role in many 
biological processes. The key to studying the various biochemical functions and 
mechanisms of Ψ is to identify the Ψ sites. However, identifying Ψ sites using 
experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary 
to develop computational methods that can accurately predict Ψ sites based on 
RNA sequence information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a new model called 
PseU-ST to identify Ψ sites in Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Mus musculus (M. musculus). We selected the best 
six encoding schemes and four machine learning algorithms based on a 
comprehensive test of almost all of the RNA sequence encoding schemes available 
in the iLearnPlus software package, and selected the optimal features for each 
encoding scheme using chi-square and incremental feature selection algorithms. 
Then, we selected the optimal feature combination and the best base-classifier 
combination for each species through an extensive performance comparison and 
employed a stacking strategy to build the predictive model. Results: The results 
demonstrated that PseU-ST achieved better prediction performance compared with 
other existing models. The PseU-ST accuracy scores were 93.64%, 87.74%, and 
89.64% on H_990, S_628, and M_944, respectively, representing increments of 
13.94%, 6.05%, and 0.26%, respectively, higher than the best existing methods on 
the same benchmark training datasets. Conclusion: The data indicate that PseU-ST 
is a very competitive prediction model for identifying RNA Ψ sites in H. 
sapiens, M. musculus, and S. cerevisiae. In addition, we found that the 
Position-specific trinucleotide propensity based on single strand (PSTNPss) and 
Position-specific of three nucleotides (PS3) features play an important role in 
Ψ site identification. The source code for PseU-ST and the data are obtainable 
in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/jluzhangxinrubio/PseU-ST).

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) plays a vital role in immunomodulatory function. 
Studies have shown that immunotherapy based on non-classical HLA has essential 
applications in cancer, COVID-19, and allergic diseases. However, there are few 
deep learning methods to predict non-classical HLA alleles. In this work, an 
adaptive dual-attention network named DapNet-HLA is established based on 
existing datasets. Firstly, amino acid sequences are transformed into digital 
vectors by looking up the table. To overcome the feature sparsity problem caused 
by unique one-hot encoding, the fused word embedding method is used to map each 
amino acid to a low-dimensional word vector optimized with the training of the 
classifier. Then, we use the GCB (group convolution block), SENet attention 
(squeeze-and-excitation networks), BiLSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory 
network), and Bahdanau attention mechanism to construct the classifier. The use 
of SENet can make the weight of the effective feature map high, so that the 
model can be trained to achieve better results. Attention mechanism is an 
Encoder-Decoder model used to improve the effectiveness of RNN, LSTM or GRU 
(gated recurrent neural network). The ablation experiment shows that DapNet-HLA 
has the best adaptability for five datasets. On the five test datasets, the ACC 
index and MCC index of DapNet-HLA are 4.89% and 0.0933 higher than the 
comparison method, respectively. According to the ROC curve and PR curve 
verified by the 5-fold cross-validation, the AUC value of each fold has a slight 
fluctuation, which proves the robustness of the DapNet-HLA. The codes and 
datasets are accessible at https://github.com/JYY625/DapNet-HLA.

Grasping good understanding of the weight-bearing spatial structure of the spine 
of a human subject in a standing position is critical for the treatment of 
spinal disorders. Such disorders are commonly diagnosed via 2D X-ray imaging of 
the human subject in a standing position. However, 3D reconstruction techniques 
based on bi-planar X-ray imaging can enable better exploration and analysis of 
the spinal structure. In particular, compared to earlier deformable modeling 
approaches, the recently-developed deep-learning-based 3D reconstruction methods 
exhibit higher efficiency and generalizability. But these methods usually employ 
simple architectures with 2D encoders and 3D decoders. Thus, these methods have 
several drawbacks, namely, the existence of a semantic gap between 
dimensionally-inconsistent feature maps, the difficulty of jointly handling 
multi-view inputs, and the information source limitations for the decoding 
process. In order to better assist clinicians and tackle these problems, we 
propose a novel convolutional neural network framework, which we call BX2S-Net, 
to effectively achieve 3D spine reconstruction based on bi-planar X-ray images. 
In particular, a dimensionally-consistent encoder-decoder architecture is 
designed in conjunction with a dimensionality enhancement method in order to 
reduce the semantic gap between feature maps and achieve information fusion for 
multi-view inputs. A feature-guided progressive decoding process is developed on 
the decoder side, where a full-scale feature attention guidance (FFAG) module is 
introduced to efficiently aggregate image features and guide the decoding 
process at each level. In addition, a class augmentation method and a 
spatially-weighted cross-entropy loss function are used for network training 
with improved reconstruction quality for the vertebral edge region. The 
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in 
reconstructing high-quality 3D spinal structures from bi-planar X-ray images.

Currently, the only effect size prior that is routinely implemented in a 
Bayesian fine-mapping multi-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis is the 
Gaussian prior. Here, we show how the Laplace prior can be deployed in Bayesian 
multi-SNP fine mapping studies. We compare the ranking performance of the 
posterior inclusion probability (PIP) using a Laplace prior with the ranking 
performance of the corresponding Gaussian prior and FINEMAP. Our results 
indicate that, for the simulation scenarios we consider here, the Laplace prior 
can lead to higher PIPs than either the Gaussian prior or FINEMAP, particularly 
for moderately sized fine-mapping studies. The Laplace prior also appears to 
have better worst-case scenario properties. We reanalyse the iCOGS case-control 
data from the CASP8 region on Chromosome 2. Even though this study has a total 
sample size of nearly 90,000 individuals, there are still some differences in 
the top few ranked SNPs if the Laplace prior is used rather than the Gaussian 
prior. R code to implement the Laplace (and Gaussian) prior is available at 
https://github.com/Kevin-walters/lapmapr.

A long-standing goal in the field of polyploid biology has been the derivation 
of mathematical models of gamete mode formation. These models form the basis of 
statistical inference and evolutionary theory. Here, we present 3-locus models 
of gamete mode formation in autotetraploids without and with preferential 
cross-over formation. The three loci are assumed to occur on one arm of the same 
chromosome. For preferential cross-over formation, one of the three loci affects 
the tendency for sets of sister chromatids to pair and therefore affects rates 
of recombination. The models are derived such that the process of double 
reduction is a function of rates of synaptic partner switches and recombination, 
as opposed to being independent of these processes. We assume potentially one 
synaptic partner switch per meiosis. We also assume the coefficient of 
coincidence is one, such that cross-over events are independent, given a set of 
cross-over rates. Illustrative cases are examined demonstrating differences in 
the gamete mode probabilities without and with preferential cross-over 
formation. Lastly, we explore the accuracy of maximum likelihood estimates of 
the probability of synaptic partner switches and preferential cross-over 
formation when the locus controlling preference is at a proximal, middle, or 
distal location on the chromosome arm. All Supplementary Information is

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite fast evolution cycles in deep learning 
methodologies for medical imaging in radiotherapy, auto-segmentation solutions 
rarely run in clinics due to the lack of open-source frameworks feasible for 
processing DICOM RT Structure Sets. Besides this shortage, available open-source 
DICOM RT Structure Set converters rely exclusively on 2D reconstruction 
approaches leading to pixelated contours with potentially low acceptance by 
healthcare professionals. PyRaDiSe, an open-source, deep learning framework 
independent Python package, addresses these issues by providing a framework for 
building auto-segmentation solutions feasible to operate directly on DICOM data. 
In addition, PyRaDiSe provides profound DICOM RT Structure Set conversion and 
processing capabilities; thus, it applies also to auto-segmentation-related 
tasks, such as dataset construction for deep learning model training.
METHODS: The PyRaDiSe package follows a holistic approach and provides DICOM 
data handling, deep learning model inference, pre-processing, and 
post-processing functionalities. The DICOM data handling allows for highly 
automated and flexible handling of DICOM image series, DICOM RT Structure Sets, 
and DICOM registrations, including 2D-based and 3D-based conversion from and to 
DICOM RT Structure Sets. For deep learning model inference, extending given 
skeleton classes is straightforwardly achieved, allowing for employing any deep 
learning framework. Furthermore, a profound set of pre-processing and 
post-processing routines is included that incorporate partial invertibility for 
restoring spatial properties, such as image origin or orientation.
RESULTS: The PyRaDiSe package, characterized by its flexibility and automated 
routines, allows for fast deployment and prototyping, reducing efforts for 
auto-segmentation pipeline implementation. Furthermore, while deep learning 
model inference is independent of the deep learning framework, it can easily be 
integrated into famous deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. 
The developed package has successfully demonstrated its capabilities in a 
research project at our institution for organs-at-risk segmentation in brain 
tumor patients. Furthermore, PyRaDiSe has shown its conversion performance for 
dataset construction.
CONCLUSIONS: The PyRaDiSe package closes the gap between data science and 
clinical radiotherapy by enabling deep learning segmentation models to be easily 
transferred into clinical research practice. PyRaDiSe is available on 
https://github.com/ubern-mia/pyradise and can be installed directly from the 
Python Package Index using pip install pyradise.

Automated model discovery for human brain using Constitutive Artificial Neural 
Networks.

The brain is our softest and most vulnerable organ, and understanding its 
physics is a challenging but significant task. Throughout the past decade, 
numerous competing models have emerged to characterize its response to 
mechanical loading. However, selecting the best constitutive model remains a 
heuristic process that strongly depends on user experience and personal 
preference. Here we challenge the conventional wisdom to first select a 
constitutive model and then fit its parameters to data. Instead, we propose a 
new strategy that simultaneously discovers both model and parameters. We 
integrate more than a century of knowledge in thermodynamics and 
state-of-the-art machine learning to build a Constitutive Artificial Neural 
Network that enables automated model discovery. Our design paradigm is to 
reverse engineer the network from a set of functional building blocks that are, 
by design, a generalization of popular constitutive models, including the neo 
Hookean, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Holzapfel models. By 
constraining input, output, activation functions, and architecture, our network 
a priori satisfies thermodynamic consistency, objectivity, symmetry, and 
polyconvexity. We demonstrate that-out of more than 4000 models-our network 
autonomously discovers the model and parameters that best characterize the 
behavior of human gray and white matter under tension, compression, and shear. 
Importantly, our network weights translate naturally into physically meaningful 
parameters, such as shear moduli of 1.82 kPa, 0.88 kPa, 0.94 kPa, and 0.54 kPa 
for the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum. Our results 
suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to 
induce a paradigm shift in soft tissue modeling, from user-defined model 
selection to automated model discovery. Our source code, data, and examples are 
available at https://github.com/LivingMatterLab/CANN. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 
Human brain is ultrasoft, difficult to test, and challenging to model. Numerous 
competing constitutive models exist, but selecting the best model remains a 
matter of personal preference. Here we automate the process of model selection. 
We formulate the problem of autonomous model discovery as a neural network and 
capitalize on the powerful optimizers in deep learning. However, rather than 
using a conventional neural network, we reverse engineer our own Constitutive 
Artificial Neural Network from a set of modular building blocks, which we 
rationalize from common constitutive models. When trained with tension, 
compression, and shear experiments of gray and white matter, our network 
simultaneously discovers both model and parameters that describes the data 
better than any existing invariant-based model. Our network could induce a 
paradigm shift from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery.

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by 
hyperglycaemia in the absence of treatment. Classification of DM is essential as 
it corresponds to the respective diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we 
propose a new coupling network with hierarchical dual-attention that utilizes 
heterogeneous data, including Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) data and biomarkers 
in electronic medical records. The long short-term memory-based FGM sub-network 
extracts the time-dependent features of dynamic FGM sequences, while the 
biomarkers sub-network learns the features of static biomarkers. The 
convolutional block attention module (CBAM) for dispersing the feature weights 
of the spatial and channel dimensions is implemented into the FGM sub-network to 
endure the variability of FGM and allows us to extract high-level discriminative 
features more accurately. To better adjust the importance weights of the 
characteristics of the two sub-networks, self-attention is introduced to 
integrate the characteristics of heterogeneous data. Based on the dataset 
provided by Peking University People's Hospital, the proposed method is 
evaluated through factorial experiments of multi-source heterogeneous data, 
ablation studies of various attention strategies, time consumption evaluation 
and quantitative evaluation. The benchmark tests reveal the proposed network 
achieves a type 1 and 2 diabetes classification accuracy of 95.835% and the 
comprehensive performance metrics, including Matthews correlation coefficient, 
F1-score and G-mean, are 91.333%, 94.939% and 94.937% respectively. In the 
factorial experiments, the proposed method reaches the maximum area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9428, which indicates the 
effectiveness of the coupling between the nominated sub-networks. The coupling 
network with a dual-attention strategy performs better than the one without or 
only with a single-attention strategy in the ablation study as well. In 
addition, the model is also tested on another data set, and the accuracy of the 
test reaches 94.286%, reflecting that the model is robust when it is transferred 
to untrained diabetes data. The experimental results show that the proposed 
method is feasible in the classification of diabetes types. The code is

As the number of protein sequences increases in biological databases, 
computational methods are required to provide accurate functional annotation 
with high coverage. Although several machine learning methods have been proposed 
for this purpose, there are still two main issues: (i) construction of reliable 
positive and negative training and validation datasets, and (ii) fair evaluation 
of their performances based on predefined experimental settings. To address 
these issues, we have developed ProFAB: Open Protein Functional Annotation 
Benchmark, which is a platform providing an infrastructure for a fair comparison 
of protein function prediction methods. ProFAB provides filtered and 
preprocessed protein annotation datasets and enables the training and evaluation 
of function prediction methods via several options. We believe that ProFAB will 
be useful for both computational and experimental researchers by enabling the 
utilization of ready-to-use datasets and machine learning algorithms for protein 
function prediction based on Gene Ontology terms and Enzyme Commission numbers.

Deep learning architecture with convolutional neural network achieves 
outstanding success in the field of computer vision. Where U-Net has made a 
great breakthrough in biomedical image segmentation and has been widely applied 
in a wide range of practical scenarios. However, the equal design of every 
downsampling layer in the encoder part and simply stacked convolutions do not 
allow U-Net to extract sufficient information of features from different depths. 
The increasing complexity of medical images brings new challenges to the 
existing methods. In this paper, we propose a deeper and more compact 
split-attention u-shape network, which efficiently utilises low-level and 
high-level semantic information based on two frameworks: primary feature 
conservation and compact split-attention block. We evaluate the proposed model 
on CVC-ClinicDB, 2018 Data Science Bowl, ISIC-2018, SegPC-2021 and BraTS-2021 
datasets. As a result, our proposed model displays better performance than other 
state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean intersection over union and dice 
coefficient. More significantly, the proposed model demonstrates excellent 
segmentation performance on challenging images. The code for our work and more 
technical details can be found at https://github.com/xq141839/DCSAU-Net.

Cocrystal engineering as an effective way to modify solid-state properties has 
inspired great interest from diverse material fields while cocrystal density is 
an important property closely correlated with the material function. In order to 
accurately predict the cocrystal density, we develop a graph neural network 
(GNN)-based deep learning framework by considering three key factors of machine 
learning (data quality, feature presentation, and model architecture). The 
result shows that different stoichiometric ratios of molecules in cocrystals can 
significantly influence the prediction performances, highlighting the importance 
of data quality. In addition, the feature complementary is not suitable for 
augmenting the molecular graph representation in the cocrystal density 
prediction, suggesting that the complementary strategy needs to consider whether 
extra features can sufficiently supplement the lacked information in the 
original representation. Based on these results, 4144 cocrystals with 1:1 
stoichiometry ratio are selected as the dataset, supplemented by the data 
augmentation of exchanging a pair of coformers. The molecular graph is 
determined to learn feature representation to train the GNN-based model. Global 
attention is introduced to further optimize the feature space and identify 
important atoms to realize the interpretability of the model. Benefited from the 
advantages, our model significantly outperforms three competitive models and 
exhibits high prediction accuracy for unseen cocrystals, showcasing its 
robustness and generality. Overall, our work not only provides a general 
cocrystal density prediction tool for experimental investigations but also 
provides useful guidelines for the machine learning application. All source

MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly popular 
technique for transcriptomic analysis of gene expression at the single-cell 
level. Cell-type clustering is the first crucial task in the analysis of 
scRNA-seq data that facilitates accurate identification of cell types and the 
study of the characteristics of their transcripts. Recently, several 
computational models based on a deep autoencoder and the ensemble clustering 
have been developed to analyze scRNA-seq data. However, current deep 
autoencoders are not sufficient to learn the latent representations of scRNA-seq 
data, and obtaining consensus partitions from these feature representations 
remains under-explored.
RESULTS: To address this challenge, we propose a single-cell deep clustering 
model via a dual denoising autoencoder with bipartite graph ensemble clustering 
called scBGEDA, to identify specific cell populations in single-cell 
transcriptome profiles. First, a single-cell dual denoising autoencoder network 
is proposed to project the data into a compressed low-dimensional space and that 
can learn feature representation via explicit modeling of synergistic 
optimization of the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) reconstruction loss 
and denoising reconstruction loss. Then, a bipartite graph ensemble clustering 
algorithm is designed to exploit the relationships between cells and the learned 
latent embedded space by means of a graph-based consensus function. Multiple 
comparison experiments were conducted on twenty scRNA-seq datasets from 
different sequencing platforms using a variety of clustering metrics. The 
experimental results indicated that scBGEDA outperforms other state-of-the-art 
methods on these datasets, and also demonstrated its scalability to large-scale 
scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, scBGEDA was able to identify cell-type specific 
marker genes and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the 
influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights into identifying cell 
types and characterizing the scRNA-seq data from different perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Loss-of-Function (LoF) variants in human genes are important due to 
their impact on clinical phenotypes and frequent occurrence in the genomes of 
healthy individuals. The association of LoF variants with complex diseases and 
traits may lead to the discovery and validation of novel therapeutic targets. 
Current approaches predict high-confidence LoF variants without identifying the 
specific genes or the number of copies they affect. Moreover, there is a lack of 
methods for detecting knockout genes caused by compound heterozygous (CH) LoF 
variants.
RESULTS: We have developed the Loss-of-Function ToolKit (LoFTK), which allows 
efficient and automated prediction of LoF variants from genotyped, imputed and 
sequenced genomes. LoFTK enables the identification of genes that are inactive 
in one or two copies and provides summary statistics for downstream analyses. 
LoFTK can identify CH LoF variants, which result in LoF genes with two copies 
lost. Using data from parents and offspring we show that 96% of CH LoF genes 
predicted by LoFTK in the offspring have the respective alleles donated by each 
parent.
CONCLUSIONS: LoFTK is a command-line based tool that provides a reliable 
computational workflow for predicting LoF variants from genotyped and sequenced 
genomes, identifying genes that are inactive in 1 or 2 copies. LoFTK is an open 
software and is freely available to non-commercial users at

As new drug targets, human microbes are proven to be closely related to human 
health. Effective computational methods for inferring potential microbe-drug 
associations can provide a useful complement to conventional experimental 
methods and will facilitate drug research and development. However, it is still 
a challenging work to predict potential interactions for new microbes or new 
drugs, since the number of known microbe-drug associations is very limited at 
present. In this manuscript, we first constructed two heterogeneous microbe-drug 
networks based on multiple measures of similarity of microbes and drugs, and 
known microbe-drug associations or known microbe-disease-drug associations, 
respectively. And then, we established two feature matrices for microbes and 
drugs through concatenating various attributes of microbes and drugs. 
Thereafter, after taking these two feature matrices and two heterogeneous 
microbe-drug networks as inputs of a two-layer graph attention network, we 
obtained low dimensional feature representations for microbes and drugs 
separately. Finally, through integrating low dimensional feature representations 
with two feature matrices to form the inputs of a convolutional neural network 
respectively, a novel computational model named GACNNMDA was designed to predict 
possible scores of microbe-drug pairs. Experimental results show that the 
predictive performance of GACNNMDA is superior to existing advanced methods. 
Furthermore, case studies on well-known microbes and drugs demonstrate the 
effectiveness of GACNNMDA as well. Source codes and supplementary materials are

Soybean is one of the most important legume crops worldwide. Soybean pests have 
a considerable impact on crop yield. Here, we integrated publicly available 
genome-wide association studies and transcriptomic data to prioritize candidate 
resistance genes against the insects Aphis glycines and Spodoptera litura, and 
the nematode Heterodera glycines. We identified 171, 7, and 228 high-confidence 
candidate resistance genes against A. glycines, S. litura, and H. glycines, 
respectively. We found some overlap of candidate genes between insect species, 
but not between insects and H. glycines. Although 15% of the prioritized 
candidate genes encode proteins of unknown function, the vast majority of the 
candidates are related to plant immunity processes, such as transcriptional 
regulation, signaling, oxidative stress, recognition, and physical defense. 
Based on the number of resistance alleles, we selected the ten most promising 
accessions against each pest species in the soybean USDA germplasm. The most 
resistant accessions do not reach the maximum theoretical resistance potential, 
indicating that they might be further improved to increase resistance in 
breeding programs or through genetic engineering. Finally, the coexpression 
networks we inferred in this work are available in a user-friendly web 
application (https://soypestgcn.venanciogroup.uenf.br/) and an R/Shiny package 
(https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/SoyPestGCN) that serve as a public resource to 
explore soybean-pest interactions at the transcriptional level.

Semantic segmentation is an essential task in medical imaging research. Many 
powerful deep-learning-based approaches can be employed for this problem, but 
they are dependent on the availability of an expansive labeled dataset. In this 
work, we augment such supervised segmentation models to be suitable for learning 
from unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised approach, termed Error-Correcting 
Mean-Teacher, uses an exponential moving average model like the original Mean 
Teacher but introduces our new paradigm of error correction. The original 
segmentation network is augmented to handle this secondary correction task. Both 
tasks build upon the core feature extraction layers of the model. For the 
correction task, features detected in the input image are fused with features 
detected in the predicted segmentation and further processed with task-specific 
decoder layers. The combination of image and segmentation features allows the 
model to correct present mistakes in the given input pair. The correction task 
is trained jointly on the labeled data. On unlabeled data, the exponential 
moving average of the original network corrects the student's prediction. The 
combined outputs of the students' prediction with the teachers' correction form 
the basis for the semi-supervised update. We evaluate our method with the 2017 
and 2018 Robotic Scene Segmentation data, the ISIC 2017 and the BraTS 2020 
Challenges, a proprietary Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection dataset, Cityscapes, 
and Pascal VOC 2012. Additionally, we analyze the impact of the individual 
components and examine the behavior when the amount of labeled data varies, with 
experiments performed on two distinct segmentation architectures. Our method 
shows improvements in terms of the mean Intersection over Union over the 
supervised baseline and competing methods. Code is available at

The detection and segmentation of individual cells or nuclei is often involved 
in image analysis across a variety of biology and biomedical applications as an 
indispensable prerequisite. However, the ubiquitous presence of crowd clusters 
with morphological variations often hinders successful instance segmentation. In 
this paper, nuclei cluster focused annotation strategies and frameworks are 
proposed to overcome this challenging practical problem. Specifically, we design 
a nucleus segmentation framework, namely ClusterSeg, to tackle nuclei clusters, 
which consists of a convolutional-transformer hybrid encoder and a 2.5-path 
decoder for precise predictions of nuclei instance mask, contours, and 
clustered-edges. Additionally, an annotation-efficient clustered-edge pointed 
strategy pinpoints the salient and error-prone boundaries, where a 
partially-supervised PS-ClusterSeg is presented using ClusterSeg as the 
segmentation backbone. The framework is evaluated with four privately curated 
image sets and two public sets with characteristic severely clustered nuclei 
across a variety range of image modalities, e.g., microscope, cytopathology, and 
histopathology images. The proposed ClusterSeg and PS-ClusterSeg are 
modality-independent and generalizable, and superior to current state-of-the-art 
approaches in multiple metrics empirically. Our collected data, the elaborate 
annotations to both public and private set, as well the source code, are 
released publicly at https://github.com/lu-yizhou/ClusterSeg.

Environmental factors affect the growth of microorganisms and therefore alter 
the composition of microbiota. Correlative analysis of the relationship between 
metagenomic composition and the environmental gradient can help elucidate key 
environmental factors and establishment principles for microbial communities. 
However, a reasonable method to quantitatively compare whole metagenomic data 
and identify the primary environmental factors for the establishment of 
microbiota has not been reported so far. In this study, we developed a method to 
compare whole proteomes deduced from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data, and 
quantitatively display their phylogenetic relationships as metagenomic trees. We 
called this method Metagenomic Phylogeny by Average Sequence Similarity (MPASS). 
We also compared one of the metagenomic trees with dendrograms of environmental 
factors using a comparison tool for phylogenetic trees. The MPASS method 
correctly constructed metagenomic trees of simulated metagenomes and soil and 
water samples. The topology of the metagenomic tree of samples from the 
Kirishima hot springs area in Japan was highly similarity to that of the 
dendrograms based on previously reported environmental factors for this area. 
The topology of the metagenomic tree also reflected the dynamics of microbiota 
at the taxonomic and functional levels. Our results strongly suggest that MPASS 
can successfully classify metagenomic shotgun sequencing data based on the 
similarity of whole protein-coding sequences, and will be useful for the 
identification of principal environmental factors for the establishment of 
microbial communities. Custom Perl script for the MPASS pipeline is available at 
https://github.com/s0sat/MPASS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) 
present a reduction in facial movements called hypomimia. In this work, we 
propose to use machine learning facial expression analysis from face images 
based on action unit domains to improve PD detection. We propose different 
domain adaptation techniques to exploit the latest advances in automatic face 
analysis and face action unit detection.
METHODS: Three different approaches are explored to model facial expressions of 
PD patients: (i) face analysis using single frame images and also using 
sequences of images, (ii) transfer learning from face analysis to action units 
recognition, and (iii) triplet-loss functions to improve the automatic 
classification between patients and healthy subjects.
RESULTS: Real face images from PD patients show that it is possible to properly 
model elicited facial expressions using image sequences (neutral, 
onset-transition, apex, offset-transition, and neutral) with accuracy 
improvements of up to 5.5% (from 72.9% to 78.4%) with respect to single-image PD 
detection. We also show that our proposed action unit domain adaptation provides 
improvements of up to 8.9% (from 78.4% to 87.3%) with respect to face analysis. 
Finally, we also show that triplet-loss functions provide improvements of up to 
3.6% (from 78.8% to 82.4%) with respect to action unit domain adaptation applied 
upon models created from scratch. The code of the experiments is available at 
https://github.com/luisf-gomez/Explorer-FE-AU-in-PD.
CONCLUSIONS: Domain adaptation via transfer learning methods seem to be a 
promising strategy to model hypomimia in PD patients. Considering the good 
results and also the fact that only up to five images per participant are 
considered in each sequence, we believe that this work is a step forward in the 
development of inexpensive computational systems suitable to model and quantify 
problems of PD patients in their facial expressions.

Multiplexed amplicon sequencing offers a cost-effective and rapid solution for 
phylogenomic studies that include a large number of individuals. Selecting 
informative genetic markers is a critical initial step in designing such 
multiplexed amplicon panels, but screening various genomic data and selecting 
markers that are informative for the question at hand can be laborious. Here, we 
present a flexible and user-friendly tool, HiMAP2, for identifying, visualizing, 
and filtering phylogenetically informative loci from diverse genomic and 
transcriptomic resources. This bioinformatics pipeline includes orthology 
prediction, exon extraction, and filtering of aligned exon sequences according 
to user-defined specifications. Additionally, HiMAP2 facilitates exploration of 
the final filtered exons by incorporating phylogenetic inference of individual 
exon trees with RAxML-NG as well as the estimation of a species tree using 
ASTRAL. Finally, results of the marker selection can be visualized and refined 
with an interactive Bokeh application that can be used to generate 
publication-quality figures. Source code and user instructions for HiMAP2 are 
available at https://github.com/popphylotools/HiMAP_v2.

MOTIVATION: Gene-disease associations are fundamental for understanding disease 
etiology and developing effective interventions and treatments. Identifying 
genes not yet associated with a disease due to a lack of studies is a 
challenging task in which prioritization based on prior knowledge is an 
important element. The computational search for new candidate disease genes may 
be eased by positive-unlabeled learning, the machine learning setting in which 
only a subset of instances are labeled as positive while the rest of the data 
set is unlabeled. In this work, we propose a set of effective network-based 
features to be used in a novel Markov diffusion-based multi-class labeling 
strategy for putative disease gene discovery.
RESULTS: The performances of the new labeling algorithm and the effectiveness of 
the proposed features have been tested on ten different disease data sets using 
three machine learning algorithms. The new features have been compared against 
classical topological and functional/ontological features and a set of network- 
and biological-derived features already used in gene discovery tasks. The 
predictive power of the integrated methodology in searching for new disease 
genes has been found to be competitive against state-of-the-art algorithms.

MOTIVATION: Mammalian cells can be transcriptionally reprogrammed to other 
cellular phenotypes. Controllability of such complex transitions in 
transcriptional networks underlying cellular phenotypes is an inherent 
biological characteristic. This network controllability can be interpreted by 
operating a few key regulators to guide the transcriptional program from one 
state to another. Finding the key regulators in the transcriptional program can 
provide key insights into the network state transition underlying cellular 
phenotypes.
RESULTS: To address this challenge, here we proposed to identify the key 
regulators in the transcriptional co-expression network as a minimum dominating 
set (MDS) of driver nodes that can fully control the network state transition. 
Based on the theory of structural controllability, we developed a weighted MDS 
network model (WMDS.net) to find the drive nodes of differential gene 
co-expression networks. The weight of WMDS.net integrates the degree of nodes in 
the network and the significance of gene co-expression difference between two 
physiological states into the measurement of node controllability of the 
transcriptional network. To confirm its validity, we applied WMDS.net to the 
discovery of cancer driver genes in RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas. WMDS.net is powerful among various cancer datasets and outperformed the 
other top-tier tools with a better balance between precision and recall.

Remote sensing (RS) image scene classification has obtained increasing attention 
for its broad application prospects. Conventional fully-supervised approaches 
usually require a large amount of manually-labeled data. As more and more RS 
images becoming available, how to make full use of these unlabeled data is 
becoming an urgent topic. Semi-supervised learning, which uses a few labeled 
data to guide the self-training of numerous unlabeled data, is an intuitive 
strategy. However, it is hard to apply it to cross-dataset (i.e., cross-domain) 
scene classification due to the significant domain shift among different 
datasets. To this end, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), which can 
reduce the domain shift and further transfer knowledge from a fully-labeled RS 
scene dataset (source domain) to a limited-labeled RS scene dataset (target 
domain), would be a feasible solution. In this paper, we propose an SSDA method 
termed bidirectional sample-class alignment (BSCA) for RS cross-domain scene 
classification. BSCA consists of two alignment strategies, unsupervised 
alignment (UA) and supervised alignment (SA), both of which can contribute to 
decreasing domain shift. UA concentrates on reducing the distance of maximum 
mean discrepancy across domains, with no demand for class labels. In contrast, 
SA aims to achieve the distribution alignment both from source samples to the 
associate target class centers and from target samples to the associate source 
class centers, with awareness of their classes. To validate the effectiveness of 
the proposed method, extensive ablation, comparison, and visualization 
experiments are conducted on an RS-SSDA benchmark built upon four widely-used RS 
scene classification datasets. Experimental results indicate that in comparison 
with some state-of-the-art methods, our BSCA achieves the superior cross-domain 
classification performance with compact feature representation and low-entropy 
classification boundary. Our code will be available at 
https://github.com/hw2hwei/BSCA.

SUMMARY: Nanopore reads encode information on the methylation status of 
cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. The length of the reads makes it comparatively 
easy to look at patterns consisting of multiple loci; here, we exploit this 
property to search for regions where one can define subpopulations of molecules 
based on methylation patterns. As an example, we run our clustering algorithm on 
known imprinted genes; we also scan chromosome 15 looking for windows 
corresponding to heterogeneous methylation. Our software can also compute the 
covariance of methylation across these regions while keeping into account the 
mixture of different types of reads.

MOTIVATION: Previous studies have shown that the heritability of multiple 
brain-related traits and disorders is highly enriched in transcriptional 
enhancer regions. However, these regions often contain many individual variants, 
while only a subset of them are likely to causally contribute to a trait. 
Statistical fine-mapping techniques can identify putative causal variants, but 
their resolution is often limited, especially in regions with multiple variants 
in high linkage disequilibrium. In these cases, alternative computational 
methods to estimate the impact of individual variants can aid in variant 
prioritization.
RESULTS: Here, we develop a deep learning pipeline to predict cell-type-specific 
enhancer activity directly from genomic sequences and quantify the impact of 
individual genetic variants in these regions. We show that the variants 
highlighted by our deep learning models are targeted by purifying selection in 
the human population, likely indicating a functional role. We integrate our deep 
learning predictions with statistical fine-mapping results for 8 brain-related 
traits, identifying 63 distinct candidate causal variants predicted to 
contribute to these traits by modulating enhancer activity, representing 6% of 
all genome-wide association study signals analyzed. Overall, our study provides 
a valuable computational method that can prioritize individual variants based on 
their estimated regulatory impact, but also highlights the limitations of 
existing methods for variant prioritization and fine-mapping.

MOTIVATION: As genome sequencing becomes cheaper and more accurate, it is 
becoming increasingly viable to merge this data with electronic health 
information to inform clinical decisions.
RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrate a full pipeline for working with both 
PacBio sequencing data and clinical FHIR® data, from initial data to tertiary 
analysis. The electronic health records are stored in FHIR® (Fast Healthcare 
Interoperability Resource) format, the current leading standard for healthcare 
data exchange. For the genomic data, we perform variant calling on long-read 
PacBio HiFi data using Cromwell on Azure. Both data formats are parsed, 
processed and merged in a single scalable pipeline which securely performs 
tertiary analyses using cloud-based Jupyter notebooks. We include three example 
applications: exporting patient information to a database, clustering patients 
and performing a simple pharmacogenomic study.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool that can be used to 
simultaneously investigate the spatial distribution of different molecules in 
samples. However, it is difficult to comprehensively analyze complex biological 
systems with only a single analytical technique due to different analytical 
properties and application limitations. Therefore, many analytical methods have 
been combined to extend data interpretation, evaluate data credibility, and 
facilitate data mining to explore important temporal and spatial relationships 
in biological systems. Image registration is an initial and critical step for 
multimodal imaging data fusion. However, the image registration of multimodal 
images is not a simple task. The property difference between each data modality 
may include spatial resolution, image characteristics, or both. The image 
registrations between MSI and different imaging techniques are often achieved 
indirectly through histology. Many methods exist for image registration between 
MSI data and histological images. However, most of them are manual or 
semiautomatic and have their prerequisites. Here, we built MSI Registrar (MSIr), 
a web service for automatic registration between MSI and histology. It can help 
to reduce subjectivity and processing time efficiently. MSIr provides an 
interface for manually selecting region of interests from histological images; 
the user selects regions of interest to extract the corresponding spectrum 
indices in MSI data. In the performance evaluation, MSIr can quickly map MSI 
data to histological images and help pinpoint molecular components at specific 
locations in tissues. Most registrations were adequate and were without 
excessive shifts. MSIr is freely available at https://msir.cmdm.tw and

This chapter describes MasterOfPores v.2 (MoP2), an open-source suite of 
pipelines for processing and analyzing direct RNA Oxford Nanopore sequencing 
data. The MoP2 relies on the Nextflow DSL2 framework and Linux containers, thus 
enabling reproducible data analysis in transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic 
studies. We introduce the key concepts of MoP2 and provide a step-by-step fully 
reproducible and complete example of how to use the workflow for the analysis of 
S. cerevisiae total RNA samples sequenced using MinION flowcells. The workflow 
starts with the pre-processing of raw FAST5 files, which includes basecalling, 
read quality control, demultiplexing, filtering, mapping, estimation of 
per-gene/transcript abundances, and transcriptome assembly, with support of the 
GPU computing for the basecalling and read demultiplexing steps. The secondary 
analyses of the workflow focus on the estimation of RNA poly(A) tail lengths and 
the identification of RNA modifications. The MoP2 code is available at 
https://github.com/biocorecrg/MOP2 and is distributed under the MIT license.

Oxford Nanopore-based long-read direct RNA sequencing protocols are being 
increasingly used to study the dynamics of RNA metabolic processes due to 
improvements in read lengths, increased throughput, decreasing cost, ease of 
library preparation, and convenience. Long-read sequencing enables 
single-molecule-based detection of posttranscriptional changes, promising novel 
insights into the functional roles of RNA. However, fulfilling this potential 
will necessitate the development of new tools for analyzing and exploring this 
type of data. Although there are tools that allow users to analyze signal 
information, such as comparing raw signal traces to a nucleotide sequence, they 
don't facilitate studying each individual signal instance in each read or 
perform analysis of signal clusters based on signal similarity. Therefore, we 
present Sequoia, a visual analytics application that allows users to 
interactively analyze signals originating from nanopore sequencers and can 
readily be extended to both RNA and DNA sequencing datasets. Sequoia combines a 
Python-based backend with a multi-view graphical interface that allows users to 
ingest raw nanopore sequencing data in Fast5 format, cluster sequences based on 
electric-current similarities, and drill-down onto signals to find attributes of 
interest. In this tutorial, we illustrate each individual step involved in 
running Sequoia and in the process dissect input data characteristics. We show 
how to generate Nanopore sequencing-based visualizations by leveraging 
dimensionality reduction and parameter tuning to separate modified RNA sequences 
from their unmodified counterparts. Sequoia's interactive features enhance 
nanopore-based computational methodologies. Sequoia enables users to construct 
rationales and hypotheses and develop insights about the dynamic nature of RNA 
from the visual analysis. Sequoia is available at

DNA methylation is a widespread epigenetic modification responsible for many 
biological regulation pathways. The development of various powerful biochemical 
assays, including conventional bisulfite treatment-based and emerging 
bisulfite-free techniques, has promised high-resolution DNA methylome profiling 
and significantly propelled the DNA methylation research field. However, the 
analysis of large-scale data generated from such assays is still complex and 
challenging. In this paper, we present a step-by-step protocol for using Msuite 
for whole-spectrum DNA methylation data analysis, from quality control, read 
alignment, to methylation call and data visualization. The Msuite package and a 
testing dataset are freely available at https://github.com/hellosunking/Msuite.

Identifying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at the resolution of single cells 
has long been a great challenge, and the advent of single-cell multi-omics data 
provides unprecedented opportunities to construct GRNs. Here, we propose a novel 
strategy to integrate omics datasets of single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing 
and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, and 
using an unsupervised learning neural network to divide the samples with high 
copy number variation scores, which are used to infer the GRN in each gene 
block. Accuracy validation of proposed strategy shows that approximately 80% of 
transcription factors are directly associated with cancer, colorectal cancer, 
malignancy and disease by TRRUST; and most transcription factors are prone to 
produce multiple transcript variants and lead to tumorigenesis by RegNetwork 
database, respectively. The source code access are available at:

In recent years, thanks to advances in computer hardware and dataset 
availability, data-driven approaches (like machine learning) have become one of 
the essential parts of the drug design framework to accelerate drug discovery 
procedures. Constructing a new scoring function, a function that can predict the 
binding score for a generated protein-ligand pose during docking procedure or a 
crystal complex, based on machine and deep learning has become an active

MOTIVATION: The assembly of contiguous sequence from metagenomic samples 
presents a particular challenge, due to the presence of multiple species, often 
closely related, at varying levels of abundance. Capturing diversity within 
species, for example, viral haplotypes, or bacterial strain-level diversity, is 
even more challenging.
RESULTS: We present MetaCortex, a metagenome assembler that captures 
intra-species diversity by searching for signatures of local variation along 
assembled sequences in the underlying assembly graph and outputting these 
sequences in sequence graph format. We show that MetaCortex produces accurate 
assemblies with higher genome coverage and contiguity than other popular 
metagenomic assemblers on mock viral communities with high levels of 
strain-level diversity and on simulated communities containing simulated 
strains.

Medical image segmentation is a challenging task due to the high variation in 
shape, size and position of infections or lesions in medical images. It is 
necessary to construct multi-scale representations to capture image contents 
from different scales. However, it is still challenging for U-Net with a simple 
skip connection to model the global multi-scale context. To overcome it, we 
proposed a dense skip-connection with cross co-attention in U-Net to solve the 
semantic gaps for an accurate automatic medical image segmentation. We name our 
method MCA-UNet, which enjoys two benefits: (1) it has a strong ability to model 
the multi-scale features, and (2) it jointly explores the spatial and channel 
attentions. The experimental results on the COVID-19 and IDRiD datasets suggest 
that our MCA-UNet produces more precise segmentation performance for the 
consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), microaneurysms (MA) and hard exudates 
(EX). The source code of this work will be released via

MOTIVATION: The theoretical possibility of determining the state and parameters 
of a dynamic model by measuring its outputs is given by its structural 
identifiability and its observability. These properties should be analysed 
before attempting to calibrate a model, but their a priori analysis can be 
challenging, requiring symbolic calculations that often have a high 
computational cost. In recent years, a number of software tools have been 
developed for this task, mostly in the systems biology community. These tools 
have vastly different features and capabilities, and a critical assessment of 
their performance is still lacking.
RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive study of the computational resources 
available for analysing structural identifiability. We consider 13 software 
tools developed in 7 programming languages and evaluate their performance using 
a set of 25 case studies created from 21 models. Our results reveal their 
strengths and weaknesses, provide guidelines for choosing the most appropriate 
tool for a given problem and highlight opportunities for future developments.

The introduction of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) into 
metagenomics enables reconstructing high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes 
(MAGs) from microbial communities. Despite recent advances in recovering 
eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal genomes using Hi-C contact maps, few of 
Hi-C-based methods are designed to retrieve viral genomes. Here we introduce 
ViralCC, a publicly available tool to recover complete viral genomes and detect 
virus-host pairs using Hi-C data. Compared to other Hi-C-based methods, ViralCC 
leverages the virus-host proximity structure as a complementary information 
source for the Hi-C interactions. Using mock and real metagenomic Hi-C datasets 
from several different microbial ecosystems, including the human gut, cow fecal, 
and wastewater, we demonstrate that ViralCC outperforms existing Hi-C-based 
binning methods as well as state-of-the-art tools specifically dedicated to 
metagenomic viral binning. ViralCC can also reveal the taxonomic structure of 
viruses and virus-host pairs in microbial communities. When applied to a real 
wastewater metagenomic Hi-C dataset, ViralCC constructs a phage-host network, 
which is further validated using CRISPR spacer analyses. ViralCC is an 
open-source pipeline available at https://github.com/dyxstat/ViralCC .

BACKGROUND: In the global effort to discover biomarkers for cancer prognosis, 
prediction tools have become essential resources. TCR (T cell receptor) 
repertoires contain important features that differentiate healthy controls from 
cancer patients or differentiate outcomes for patients being treated with 
different drugs. Considering, tools that can easily and quickly generate and 
identify important features out of TCR repertoire data and build accurate 
classifiers to predict future outcomes are essential.
RESULTS: This paper introduces GENTLE (GENerator of T cell receptor repertoire 
features for machine LEarning): an open-source, user-friendly web-application 
tool that allows TCR repertoire researchers to discover important features; to 
create classifier models and evaluate them with metrics; and to quickly generate 
visualizations for data interpretations. We performed a case study with 
repertoires of TRegs (regulatory T cells) and TConvs (conventional T cells) from 
healthy controls versus patients with breast cancer. We showed that diversity 
features were able to distinguish between the groups. Moreover, the classifiers 
built with these features could correctly classify samples ('Healthy' or 'Breast 
Cancer')from the TRegs repertoire when trained with the TConvs repertoire, and 
from the TConvs repertoire when trained with the TRegs repertoire.
CONCLUSION: The paper walks through installing and using GENTLE and presents a 
case study and results to demonstrate the application's utility. GENTLE is 
geared towards any researcher working with TCR repertoire data and aims to 
discover predictive features from these data and build accurate classifiers.

Cancer genomics tailors diagnosis and treatment based on an individual's genetic 
information and is the crux of precision medicine. However, analysis and 
maintenance of high volume of genetic mutation data to build a machine learning 
(ML) model to predict the cancer type is a computationally expensive task and is 
often outsourced to powerful cloud servers, raising critical privacy concerns 
for patients' data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted 
data, thus, providing cryptographic guarantees to protect privacy. But 
restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this work, we 
explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer type prediction using a 
dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic mutations from 2713 patients 
for several cancer types by building a highly accurate ML model and then 
implementing its privacy preserving version in HE. Our solution for cancer type 
inference encodes somatic mutations based on their impact on the cancer genomes 
into the feature space and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. We 
propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm for HE-based model. Our final 
model achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve improving accuracy from 70.08 
to 83.61% , being 550 times faster than the standard matrix multiplication-based 
privacy-preserving models. Our tool can be found at

Biomedical image segmentation is one critical component in computer-aided system 
diagnosis. However, various non-automatic segmentation methods are usually 
designed to segment target objects with single-task driven, ignoring the 
potential contribution of multi-task, such as the salient object detection (SOD) 
task and the image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel 
dual-task framework for white blood cell (WBC) and skin lesion (SL) saliency 
detection and segmentation in biomedical images, called Saliency-CCE. 
Saliency-CCE consists of a preprocessing of hair removal for skin lesions 
images, a novel colour contextual extractor (CCE) module for the SOD task and an 
improved adaptive threshold (AT) paradigm for the image segmentation task. In 
the SOD task, we perform the CCE module to extract hand-crafted features through 
a novel colour channel volume (CCV) block and a novel colour activation mapping 
(CAM) block. We first exploit the CCV block to generate a target object's region 
of interest (ROI). After that, we employ the CAM block to yield a refined 
salient map as the final salient map from the extracted ROI. We propose a novel 
adaptive threshold (AT) strategy in the segmentation task to automatically 
segment the WBC and SL from the final salient map. We evaluate our proposed 
Saliency-CCE on the ISIC-2016, the ISIC-2017, and the SCISC datasets, which 
outperform representative state-of-the-art SOD and biomedical image segmentation 
approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/zxg3017/Saliency-CCE.

MOTIVATION: Predicting the associations between human microbes and drugs (MDAs) 
is one critical step in drug development and precision medicine areas. Since 
discovering these associations through wet experiments is time-consuming and 
labor-intensive, computational methods have already been an effective way to 
tackle this problem. Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) approaches have 
shown great advantages in learning the embeddings of nodes from heterogeneous 
biological graphs (HBGs). However, most GCL-based approaches don't fully capture 
the rich structure information in HBGs. Besides, fewer MDA prediction methods 
could screen out the most informative negative samples for effectively training 
the classifier. Therefore, it still needs to improve the accuracy of MDA 
predictions.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs the 
Structure-enhanced Contrastive learning and Self-paced negative sampling 
strategy for Microbe-Drug Association predictions (SCSMDA). Firstly, SCSMDA 
constructs the similarity networks of microbes and drugs, as well as their 
different meta-path-induced networks. Then SCSMDA employs the representations of 
microbes and drugs learned from meta-path-induced networks to enhance their 
embeddings learned from the similarity networks by the contrastive learning 
strategy. After that, we adopt the self-paced negative sampling strategy to 
select the most informative negative samples to train the MLP classifier. 
Lastly, SCSMDA predicts the potential microbe-drug associations with the trained 
MLP classifier. The embeddings of microbes and drugs learning from the 
similarity networks are enhanced with the contrastive learning strategy, which 
could obtain their discriminative representations. Extensive results on three 
public datasets indicate that SCSMDA significantly outperforms other baseline 
methods on the MDA prediction task. Case studies for two common drugs could 
further demonstrate the effectiveness of SCSMDA in finding novel MDA 
associations.

A large number of works have presented the single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) to study the diversity and biological functions of cells at the 
single-cell level. Clustering identifies unknown cell types, which is essential 
for downstream analysis of scRNA-seq samples. However, the high dimensionality, 
high noise and pervasive dropout rate of scRNA-seq samples have a significant 
challenge to the cluster analysis of scRNA-seq samples. Herein, we propose a new 
adaptive fuzzy clustering model based on the denoising autoencoder and 
self-attention mechanism called the scDASFK. It implements the comparative 
learning to integrate cell similar information into the clustering method and 
uses a deep denoising network module to denoise the data. scDASFK consists of a 
self-attention mechanism for further denoising where an adaptive clustering 
optimization function for iterative clustering is implemented. In order to make 
the denoised latent features better reflect the cell structure, we introduce a 
new adaptive feedback mechanism to supervise the denoising process through the 
clustering results. Experiments on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets show that scDASFK 
performs well in terms of clustering accuracy, scalability and stability. 
Overall, scDASFK is an effective clustering model with great potential for 
scRNA-seq samples analysis. Our scDASFK model codes are freely available at

The advance in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) sheds light on 
cell-specific transcriptomic studies of cell developments, complex diseases and 
cancers. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq techniques suffer from 'dropout' events, and 
imputation tools are proposed to address the sparsity. Here, rather than 
imputation, we propose a tool, SMURF, to extract the low-dimensional embeddings 
from cells and genes utilizing matrix factorization with a mixture of 
Poisson-Gamma divergent as objective while preserving self-consistency. SMURF 
exhibits feasible cell subpopulation discovery efficacy with obtained cell 
embeddings on replicated in silico and eight web lab scRNA datasets with ground 
truth cell types. Furthermore, SMURF can reduce the cell embedding to a 1D-oval 
space to recover the time course of cell cycle. SMURF can also serve as an 
imputation tool; the in silico data assessment shows that SMURF parades the most 
robust gene expression recovery power with low root mean square error and high 
Pearson correlation. Moreover, SMURF recovers the gene distribution for the 
WM989 Drop-seq data. SMURF is available at

iEnhancer-SKNN: a stacking ensemble learning-based method for enhancer 
identification and classification using sequence information.

Enhancers, a class of distal cis-regulatory elements located in the non-coding 
region of DNA, play a key role in gene regulation. It is difficult to identify 
enhancers from DNA sequence data because enhancers are freely distributed in the 
non-coding region, with no specific sequence features, and having a long 
distance with the targeted promoters. Therefore, this study presents a stacking 
ensemble learning method to accurately identify enhancers and classify enhancers 
into strong and weak enhancers. Firstly, we obtain the fusion feature matrix by 
fusing the four features of Kmer, PseDNC, PCPseDNC and Z-Curve9. Secondly, five 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models with different parameters are trained as the 
base model, and the Logistic Regression algorithm is utilized as the meta-model. 
Thirdly, the stacking ensemble learning strategy is utilized to construct a 
two-layer model based on the base model and meta-model to train the preprocessed 
feature sets. The proposed method, named iEnhancer-SKNN, is a two-layer 
prediction model, in which the function of the first layer is to predict whether 
the given DNA sequences are enhancers or non-enhancers, and the function of the 
second layer is to distinguish whether the predicted enhancers are strong 
enhancers or weak enhancers. The performance of iEnhancer-SKNN is evaluated on 
the independent testing dataset and the results show that the proposed method 
has better performance in predicting enhancers and their strength. In enhancer 
identification, iEnhancer-SKNN achieves an accuracy of 81.75%, an improvement of 
1.35% to 8.75% compared with other predictors, and in enhancer classification, 
iEnhancer-SKNN achieves an accuracy of 80.50%, an improvement of 5.5% to 25.5% 
compared with other predictors. Moreover, we identify key transcription factor 
binding site motifs in the enhancer regions and further explore the biological 
functions of the enhancers and these key motifs. Source code and data can be 
downloaded from https://github.com/HaoWuLab-Bioinformatics/iEnhancer-SKNN.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly considered to be 
state-of-the-art generic end-to-end image classification systems. However, they 
are known to underperform when training data are limited and thus require data 
augmentation strategies that render the method computationally expensive and not 
always effective. Rather than using a data augmentation strategy to encode 
invariances as typically done in machine learning, here we propose to 
mathematically augment a nearest subspace classification model in 
sliced-Wasserstein space by exploiting certain mathematical properties of the 
Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (R-CDT), a recently introduced image 
transform. We demonstrate that for a particular type of learning problem, our 
mathematical solution has advantages over data augmentation with deep CNNs in 
terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity, and is 
particularly effective under a limited training data setting. The method is 
simple, effective, computationally efficient, non-iterative, and requires no 
parameters to be tuned. Python code implementing our method is available at 
https://github.com/rohdelab/mathematical augmentation. Our method is integrated 
as a part of the software package PyTransKit, which is available at 
https://github.com/rohdelab/PyTransKit.

supérieure, CNRS, INSERM, Paris 75005, France.

MOTIVATION: FASTA files are the de facto standard for sharing, manipulating and 
storing biological sequences, while concatenated in multiFASTA they tend to be 
unwieldy for two main reasons: (i) they can become big enough that their 
manipulation with standard text-editing tools is unpractical, either due to 
slowness or memory consumption; (ii) by mixing metadata (headers) and data 
(sequences), bulk operations using standard text streaming tools (such as sed or 
awk) are impossible without including a parsing step, which may be error-prone 
and introduce friction in the development process.
RESULTS: Here, we present FUSTA (FUse for faSTA), a software utility which makes 
use of the FUSE technology to expose a multiFASTA file as a hierarchy of virtual 
files, letting users operate directly on the sequences as independent virtual 
files through classical file manipulation methods.

β-LacFamPred: An online tool for prediction and classification of β-lactamase 
class, subclass, and family.

β-Lactams are a broad class of antimicrobial agents with a high safety profile, 
making them the most widely used class in clinical, agricultural, and veterinary 
setups. The widespread use of β-lactams has induced the extensive spread of 
β-lactamase hydrolyzing enzymes known as β-lactamases (BLs). To neutralize the 
effect of β-lactamases, newer generations of β-lactams have been developed, 
which ultimately led to the evolution of a highly diverse family of BLs. Based 
on sequence homology, BLs are categorized into four classes: A-D in Ambler's 
classification system. Further, each class is subdivided into families. Class B 
is first divided into subclasses B1-B3, and then each subclass is divided into 
families. The class to which a BL belongs gives a lot of insight into its 
hydrolytic profile. Traditional methods of determining the hydrolytic profile of 
BLs and their classification are time-consuming and require resources. Hence we 
developed a machine-learning-based in silico method, named as β-LacFamPred, for 
the prediction and annotation of Ambler's class, subclass, and 96 families of 
BLs. During leave-one-out cross-validation, except one all β-LacFamPred model 
HMMs showed 100% accuracy. Benchmarking with other BL family prediction methods 
showed β-LacFamPred to be the most accurate. Out of 60 penicillin-binding 
proteins (PBPs) and 57 glyoxalase II proteins, β-LacFamPred correctly predicted 
56 PBPs and none of the glyoxalase II sequences as non-BLs. Proteome-wide 
annotation of BLs by β-LacFamPred showed a very less number of false-positive 
predictions in comparison to the recently developed BL class prediction tool 
DeepBL. β-LacFamPred is available both as a web-server and standalone tool at 
http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/blacfampred and GitHub repository 
https://github.com/mkubiophysics/B-LacFamPred respectively.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has devastating effects on personal 
health around the world. It is significant to achieve accurate segmentation of 
pulmonary infection regions, which is an early indicator of disease. To solve 
this problem, a deep learning model, namely, the content-aware pre-activated 
residual UNet (CAPA-ResUNet), was proposed for segmenting COVID-19 lesions from 
CT slices. In this network, the pre-activated residual block was used for 
down-sampling to solve the problems of complex foreground and large fluctuations 
of distribution in datasets during training and to avoid gradient disappearance. 
The area loss function based on the false segmentation regions was proposed to 
solve the problem of fuzzy boundary of the lesion area. This model was evaluated 
by the public dataset (COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge-2020) and 
compared its performance with those of classical models. Our method gains an 
advantage over other models in multiple metrics. Such as the Dice coefficient, 
specificity (Spe), and intersection over union (IoU), our CAPA-ResUNet obtained 
0.775 points, 0.972 points, and 0.646 points, respectively. The Dice coefficient 
of our model was 2.51% higher than Content-aware residual UNet (CARes-UNet). The 
code is available at https://github.com/malu108/LungInfectionSeg.

miRdisNET: Discovering microRNA biomarkers that are associated with diseases 
utilizing biological knowledge-based machine learning.

During recent years, biological experiments and increasing evidence have shown 
that microRNAs play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of human 
complex diseases. Therefore, to diagnose and treat human complex diseases, it is 
necessary to reveal the associations between a specific disease and related 
miRNAs. Although current computational models based on machine learning attempt 
to determine miRNA-disease associations, the accuracy of these models need to be 
improved, and candidate miRNA-disease relations need to be evaluated from a 
biological perspective. In this paper, we propose a computational model named 
miRdisNET to predict potential miRNA-disease associations. Specifically, 
miRdisNET requires two types of data, i.e., miRNA expression profiles and known 
disease-miRNA associations as input files. First, we generate subsets of 
specific diseases by applying the grouping component. These subsets contain 
miRNA expressions with class labels associated with each specific disease. Then, 
we assign an importance score to each group by using a machine learning method 
for classification. Finally, we apply a modeling component and obtain outputs. 
One of the most important outputs of miRdisNET is the performance of 
miRNA-disease prediction. Compared with the existing methods, miRdisNET obtained 
the highest AUC value of .9998. Another output of miRdisNET is a list of 
significant miRNAs for disease under study. The miRNAs identified by miRdisNET 
are validated via referring to the gold-standard databases which hold 
information on experimentally verified microRNA-disease associations. miRdisNET 
has been developed to predict candidate miRNAs for new diseases, where 
miRNA-disease relation is not yet known. In addition, miRdisNET presents 
candidate disease-disease associations based on shared miRNA knowledge. The 
miRdisNET tool and other supplementary files are publicly available at:

HQAlign: Aligning nanopore reads for SV detection using current-level modeling.

Joshi D, Diggavi S, Chaisson MJP, Kannan S.

MOTIVATION: Detection of structural variants (SV) from the alignment of sample 
DNA reads to the reference genome is an important problem in understanding human 
diseases. Long reads that can span repeat regions, along with an accurate 
alignment of these long reads play an important role in identifying novel SVs. 
Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can address this problem by 
providing very long reads but with high error rates, making accurate alignment 
challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore sequencing have a bias because of 
the physics of the sequencing process and proper utilization of these error 
characteristics can play an important role in designing a robust aligner for SV 
detection problems. In this paper, we design and evaluate HQAlign, an aligner 
for SV detection using nanopore sequenced reads. The key ideas of HQAlign 
include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads along with the nanopore physics to 
improve alignments for SVs (ii) incorporating SV specific changes to the 
alignment pipeline (iii) adapting these into existing state-of-the-art long read 
aligner pipeline, minimap2 (v2.24), for efficient alignments.
RESULTS: We show that HQAlign captures about 4 - 6% complementary SVs across 
different datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a 
standalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For 
the common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start and 
the end breakpoint accuracy for about 10 - 50% of SVs across different datasets. 
Moreover, HQAlign improves the alignment rate to 89.35% from minimap2 85.64% for 
nanopore reads alignment to recent telomere-to-telomere CHM13 assembly, and it 
improves to 86.65% from 83.48% for nanopore reads alignment to GRCh37 human 
genome.

Recursive Prefix-Free Parsing for Building Big BWTs.

Oliva M, Gagie T, Boucher C.

Update in
    Algorithms Mol Biol. 2019 May 24;14:13.

Prefix-free parsing is useful for a wide variety of purposes including building 
the BWT, constructing the suffix array, and supporting compressed suffix tree 
operations. This linear-time algorithm uses a rolling hash to break an input 
string into substrings, where the resulting set of unique substrings has the 
property that none of the substrings' suffixes (of more than a certain length) 
is a proper prefix of any of the other substrings' suffixes. Hence, the name 
prefix-free parsing. This set of unique substrings is referred to as the 
dictionary . The parse is the ordered list of dictionary strings that defines 
the input string. Prior empirical results demonstrated the size of the parse is 
more burdensome than the size of the dictionary for large, repetitive inputs. 
Hence, the question arises as to how the size of the parse can scale 
satisfactorily with the input. Here, we describe our algorithm, recursive 
prefix-free parsing , which accomplishes this by computing the prefix-free parse 
of the parse produced by prefix-free parsing an input string. Although 
conceptually simple, building the BWT from the parse-of-the-parse and the 
dictionaries is significantly more challenging. We solve and implement this 
problem. Our experimental results show that recursive prefix-free parsing is 
extremely effective in reducing the memory needed to build the run-length 
encoded BWT of the input. Our implementation is open source and available at 
https://github.com/marco-oliva/r-pfbwt .

HiCLift: A fast and efficient tool for converting chromatin interaction data 
between genome assemblies.

Wang X, Yue F.

MOTIVATION: With the continuous effort to improve the quality of human reference 
genome and the generation of more and more personal genomes, the conversion of 
genomic coordinates between genome assemblies is critical in many integrative 
and comparative studies. While tools have been developed for such task for 
linear genome signals such as ChIP-Seq, no tool exists to convert genome 
assemblies for chromatin interaction data, despite the importance of 
three-dimensional (3D) genome organization in gene regulation and disease.
RESULTS: Here, we present HiCLift, a fast and efficient tool that can convert 
the genomic coordinates of chromatin contacts such as Hi-C and Micro-C from one 
assembly to another, including the latest T2T genome. Comparing with the 
strategy of directly re-mapping raw reads to a different genome, HiCLift runs on 
average 42 times faster (hours vs. days), while outputs nearly identical contact 
matrices. More importantly, as HiCLift does not need to re-map the raw reads, it 
can directly convert human patient sample data, where the raw sequencing reads 
are sometimes hard to acquire or not available.

LRphase: an efficient method for assigning haplotype identity to long reads.

Holmes MJ, Mahjour B, Castro CP, Farnum GA, Diehl AG, Boyle AP.

MOTIVATION: Understanding the functional effects of sequence variation is among 
the primary goals of contemporary genomics. Individual human genomes contain 
millions of variants which are thought to contribute to phenotypic variability 
and differential disease risks at the population level. However, because 
variants rarely act in isolation, we cannot accurately predict functional 
effects without first considering the potential effects of other interacting 
variants on the same chromosome. This information can be obtained by phasing the 
read data from sequencing experiments. However, no standalone tools are 
available to simply phase reads based on known haplotypes. Here we present

PASTE2: Partial Alignment of Multi-slice Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics 
Data.

Liu X, Zeira R, Raphael BJ.

Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies measure mRNA expression at 
thousands of locations in a tissue slice. However, nearly all SRT technologies 
measure expression in two dimensional slices extracted from a three-dimensional 
tissue, thus losing information that is shared across multiple slices from the 
same tissue. Integrating SRT data across multiple slices can help recover this 
information and improve downstream expression analyses, but multi-slice 
alignment and integration remains a challenging task. Existing methods for 
integrating SRT data either do not use spatial information or assume that the 
morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an assumption that 
is often violated due to biological or technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a 
method for partial alignment and 3D reconstruction of multi-slice SRT datasets, 
allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or slice-specific cell 
types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal 
Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 
includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between 
slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany 
some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 
obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to 
reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice 
Stereo-seq dataset. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multi-slice datasets 
from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of spatial gene 
expression across a wide range of biological applications.

Integrative proteogenomics using ProteomeGenerator2.

Kwok N, Aretz Z, Takao S, Ser Z, Cifani P, Kentsis A.

Recent advances in nucleic acid sequencing now permit rapid and genome-scale 
analysis of genetic variation and transcription, enabling population-scale 
studies of human biology, disease, and diverse organisms. Likewise, advances in 
mass spectrometry proteomics now permit highly sensitive and accurate studies of 
protein expression at the whole proteome-scale. However, most proteomic studies 
rely on consensus databases to match spectra to peptide and proteins sequences, 
and thus remain limited to the analysis of canonical protein sequences. Here, we 
develop ProteomeGenerator2 (PG2), based on the scalable and modular 
ProteomeGenerator framework. PG2 integrates genome and transcriptome sequencing 
to incorporate protein variants containing amino acid substitutions, insertions, 
and deletions, as well as non-canonical reading frames, exons, and other 
variants caused by genomic and transcriptomic variation. We benchmarked PG2 
using synthetic data and genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis of 
human leukemia cells. PG2 can be integrated with current and emerging sequencing 
technologies, assemblers, variant callers, and mass spectral analysis 
algorithms, and is available open-source from 
https://github.com/kentsisresearchgroup/ProteomeGenerator2 .

Phenotypic subtyping via contrastive learning.

Gorla A, Sankararaman S, Burchard E, Flint J, Zaitlen N, Rahmani E.

Defining and accounting for subphenotypic structure has the potential to 
increase statistical power and provide a deeper understanding of the 
heterogeneity in the molecular basis of complex disease. Existing phenotype 
subtyping methods primarily rely on clinically observed heterogeneity or 
metadata clustering. However, they generally tend to capture the dominant 
sources of variation in the data, which often originate from variation that is 
not descriptive of the mechanistic heterogeneity of the phenotype of interest; 
in fact, such dominant sources of variation, such as population structure or 
technical variation, are, in general, expected to be independent of 
subphenotypic structure. We instead aim to find a subspace with signal that is 
unique to a group of samples for which we believe that subphenotypic variation 
exists (e.g., cases of a disease). To that end, we introduce Phenotype Aware 
Components Analysis (PACA), a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical 
correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic 
variation. In the context of disease, PACA learns a gradient of variation unique 
to cases in a given dataset, while leveraging control samples for accounting for 
variation and imbalances of biological and technical confounders between cases 
and controls. We evaluated PACA using an extensive simulation study, as well as 
on various subtyping tasks using genotypes, transcriptomics, and DNA methylation 
data. Our results provide multiple strong evidence that PACA allows us to 
robustly capture weak unknown variation of interest while being calibrated and 
well-powered, far superseding the performance of alternative methods. This 
renders PACA as a state-of-the-art tool for defining de novo subtypes that are 
more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases 
where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated 
effects in the data.

The probability of edge existence due to node degree: a baseline for 
network-based predictions.

Zietz M, Himmelstein DS, Kloster K, Williams C, Nagle MW, Greene CS.

Important tasks in biomedical discovery such as predicting gene functions, 
gene-disease associations, and drug repurposing opportunities are often framed 
as network edge prediction. The number of edges connecting to a node, termed 
degree, can vary greatly across nodes in real biomedical networks, and the 
distribution of degrees varies between networks. If degree strongly influences 
edge prediction, then imbalance or bias in the distribution of degrees could 
lead to nonspecific or misleading predictions. We introduce a network 
permutation framework to quantify the effects of node degree on edge prediction. 
Our framework decomposes performance into the proportions attributable to degree 
and the network's specific connections. We discover that performance 
attributable to factors other than degree is often only a small portion of 
overall performance. Degree's predictive performance diminishes when the 
networks used for training and testing-despite measuring the same biological 
relationships-were generated using distinct techniques and hence have large 
differences in degree distribution. We introduce the permutation-derived edge 
prior as the probability that an edge exists based only on degree. The edge 
prior shows excellent discrimination and calibration for 20 biomedical networks 
(16 bipartite, 3 undirected, 1 directed), with AUROCs frequently exceeding 0.85. 
Researchers seeking to predict new or missing edges in biological networks 
should use the edge prior as a baseline to identify the fraction of performance 
that is nonspecific because of degree. We released our methods as an open-source 
Python package ( https://github.com/hetio/xswap/ ).

ConDoR: Tumor phylogeny inference with a copy-number constrained mutation loss 
model.

Sashittal P, Zhang H, Iacobuzio-Donahue CA, Raphael BJ.

Tumors consist of subpopulations of cells that harbor distinct collections of 
somatic mutations. These mutations range in scale from single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) to large-scale copy-number aberrations (CNAs). While many 
approaches infer tumor phylogenies using SNVs as phylogenetic markers, CNAs that 
overlap SNVs may lead to erroneous phylogenetic inference. Specifically, an SNV 
may be lost in a cell due to a deletion of the genomic segment containing the 
SNV. Unfortunately, no current single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) technology 
produces accurate measurements of both SNVs and CNAs. For instance, recent 
targeted scDNA-seq technologies, such as Mission Bio Tapestri, measure SNVs with 
high fidelity in individual cells, but yield much less reliable measurements of 
CNAs. We introduce a new evolutionary model, the constrained k-Dollo model , 
that uses SNVs as phylogenetic markers and partial information about CNAs in the 
form of clustering of cells with similar copy-number profiles. This copy-number 
clustering constrains where loss of SNVs can occur in the phylogeny. We develop 
ConDoR (Constrained Dollo Reconstruction), an algorithm to infer tumor 
phylogenies from targeted scDNA-seq data using the constrained k -Dollo model. 
We show that ConDoR outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We use 
ConDoR to analyze a new multi-region targeted scDNA-seq dataset of 2153 cells 
from a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor and produce a more 
plausible phylogeny compared to existing methods that conforms to histological 
results for the tumor from a previous study. We also analyze a metastatic 
colorectal cancer dataset, deriving a more parsimonious phylogeny than 
previously published analyses and with a simpler monoclonal origin of metastasis 
compared to the original study.

Combining protein sequences and structures with transformers and equivariant 
graph neural networks to predict protein function.

Boadu F, Cao H, Cheng J.

MOTIVATION: Millions of protein sequences have been generated by numerous genome 
and transcriptome sequencing projects. However, experimentally determining the 
function of the proteins is still a time consuming, low-throughput, and 
expensive process, leading to a large protein sequence-function gap. Therefore, 
it is important to develop computational methods to accurately predict protein 
function to fill the gap. Even though many methods have been developed to use 
protein sequences as input to predict function, much fewer methods leverage 
protein structures in protein function prediction because there was lack of 
accurate protein structures for most proteins until recently.
RESULTS: We developed TransFun - a method using a transformer-based protein 
language model and 3D-equivariant graph neural networks to distill information 
from both protein sequences and structures to predict protein function. It 
extracts feature embeddings from protein sequences using a pre-trained protein 
language model (ESM) via transfer learning and combines them with 3D structures 
of proteins predicted by AlphaFold2 through equivariant graph neural networks. 
Benchmarked on the CAFA3 test dataset and a new test dataset, TransFun 
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, indicating the language model and 
3D-equivariant graph neural networks are effective methods to leverage protein 
sequences and structures to improve protein function prediction. Combining 
TransFun predictions and sequence similarity-based predictions can further 
increase prediction accuracy.

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) occupy ~98% of the transcriptome in human, and are 
usually not translated into proteins. Among ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs, >200 nucleotides) are important regulators to modulate gene 
expression, and are involved in many biological processes (e.g., cell 
development). To study lncRNA regulation, many computational approaches or tools 
have been proposed by using bulk transcriptomics data. Nevertheless, previous 
bulk data-driven methods are mostly limited to explore the lncRNA regulation 
regarding all of cells, instead of the lncRNA regulation specific to cell 
developmental stages. Fortunately, recent advance in single-cell sequencing data 
has provided a way to investigate cell developmental stage-specific lncRNA 
regulation. In this work, we present a novel computational method, CDSlncR (Cell 
Developmental Stage-specific lncRNA regulation), which combines putative 
lncRNA-target binding information with single-cell transcriptomics data to infer 
cell developmental stage-specific lncRNA regulation. For each cell developmental 
stage, CDSlncR constructs a cell developmental stage-specific lncRNA regulatory 
network in the cell developmental stage. To illustrate the effectiveness of 
CDSlncR, we apply CDSlncR into single-cell transcriptomics data of the 
developing human neocortex for exploring lncRNA regulation across different 
human neocortex developmental stages. Network analysis shows that the lncRNA 
regulation is unique in each developmental stage of human neocortex. As a case 
study, we also perform particular analysis on the cell developmental 
stage-specific lncRNA regulation related to 18 known lncRNA biomarkers in autism 
spectrum disorder. Finally, the comparison result indicates that CDSlncR is an 
effective method for predicting cell developmental stage-specific lncRNA 
targets. CDSlncR is available at https://github.com/linxi159/CDSlncR.

BACKGROUND: Identifying the cell types using unsupervised methods is essential 
for scRNA-seq research. However, conventional similarity measures introduce 
challenges to single-cell data clustering because of the high dimensional, high 
noise, and high dropout.
METHODS: We proposed a clustering method for small ScRNA-seq data based on 
Subspace and Weighted Distance (SSWD), which follows the assumption that the 
sets of gene subspace composed of similar density-distributing genes can better 
distinguish cell groups. To accurately capture the intrinsic relationship among 
cells or genes, a new distance metric that combines Euclidean and Pearson 
distance through a weighting strategy was proposed. The relative 
Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index was used to estimate the cluster numbers instead of 
the CH index because it is comparable across degrees of freedom.
RESULTS: We compared SSWD with seven prevailing methods on eight publicly 
scRNA-seq datasets. The experimental results show that the SSWD has better 
clustering accuracy and the partitioning ability of cell groups. SSWD can be 
downloaded at https://github.com/ningzilan/SSWD.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are shown to be closely associated with cancer 
metastatic events (CME, e.g., cancer cell invasion, intravasation, 
extravasation, proliferation) that collaboratively accelerate malignant cancer 
spread and cause high mortality rate in patients. Clinical trials may accurately 
uncover the relationships between lncRNAs and CMEs; however, it is 
time-consuming and expensive. With the accumulation of data, there is an urgent 
need to find efficient ways to identify these relationships. Herein, a graph 
embedding representation-based predictor (VGEA-LCME) for exploring latent 
lncRNA-CME associations is introduced. In VGEA-LCME, a heterogeneous combined 
network is constructed by integrating similarity and linkage matrix that can 
maintain internal and external characteristics of networks, and a variational 
graph auto-encoder serves as a feature generator to represent arbitrary lncRNA 
and CME pair. The final robustness predicted result is obtained by ensemble 
classifier strategy via cross-validation. Experimental comparisons and 
literature verification show better remarkable performance of VGEA-LCME, 
although the similarities between CMEs are challenging to calculate. In 
addition, VGEA-LCME can further identify organ-specific CMEs. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first computational attempt to discover the potential 
relationships between lncRNAs and CMEs. It may provide support and new insight 
for guiding experimental research of metastatic cancers. The source code and 
data are available at https://github.com/zhuyuan-cug/VGAE-LCME.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Automatic segmentation of the cerebral vasculature 
and aneurysms facilitates incidental detection of aneurysms. The assessment of 
aneurysm rupture risk assists with pre-operative treatment planning and enables 
in-silico investigation of cerebral hemodynamics within and in the vicinity of 
aneurysms. However, ensuring precise and robust segmentation of cerebral vessels 
and aneurysms in neuroimaging modalities such as three-dimensional rotational 
angiography (3DRA) is challenging. The vasculature constitutes a small 
proportion of the image volume, resulting in a large class imbalance (relative 
to surrounding brain tissue). Additionally, aneurysms and vessels have similar 
image/appearance characteristics, making it challenging to distinguish the 
aneurysm sac from the vessel lumen.
METHODS: We propose a novel multi-class convolutional neural network to tackle 
these challenges and facilitate the automatic segmentation of cerebral vessels 
and aneurysms in 3DRA images. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on an 
internal multi-center dataset and an external publicly available challenge 
dataset.
RESULTS: On the internal clinical dataset, our method consistently outperformed 
several state-of-the-art approaches for vessel and aneurysm segmentation, 
achieving an average Dice score of 0.81 (0.15 higher than nnUNet) and an average 
surface-to-surface error of 0.20 mm (less than the in-plane resolution 
(0.35 mm/pixel)) for aneurysm segmentation; and an average Dice score of 0.91 
and average surface-to-surface error of 0.25 mm for vessel segmentation. In 223 
cases of a clinical dataset, our method accurately segmented 190 aneurysm cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach can help address class imbalance problems and 
inter-class interference problems in multi-class segmentation. Besides, this 
method performs consistently on clinical datasets from four different sources 
and the generated results are qualified for hemodynamic simulation. Code
